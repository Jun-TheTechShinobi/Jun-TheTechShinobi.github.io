      <title>On Windows: 11 LTSC Debloat, 7 Nostalgia, Linux and Its Discontents</title>

      <description>Windows Nostalgia A recent video on Windows 7 as daily driver OS by Brodie Robertson was hilarious but also arguable.
For me, XP is the best OS ever made by M$. However, it has became not so useful nowadays neither for retro gaming (which 98SE is the king) nor for day-to-day usage, due to both hardware and software incompatibility.
The compromise would be Windows 7. I agree there are too much of accumulated unpatched security vulnerabilities, but there are tricks to mitigate most of those either technically or strategically.</description>

      <title>Set up Monero Wallet Securely with Anonymity</title>

      <description>Eventually, I found myself with enough leisure and motivation to set up a crypto wallet. For my situation, investing time and money into my skills, knowledge, and projects yields more return and safer than in finance.
But in this time, I found some good VPN deals which I would like to pay with XMR. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to have some spare crypto in wallet for making donations to my favorite creators and projects, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to set things up.</description>

      <title>Dealing with the Enshittification of Proton VPN on Free Plan&#39;s Server Selection</title>

      <description>As a early adopter of Protonmail, I use their later coming VPN product as well, regularly yet lightly. Although I&amp;rsquo;m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.
Being a free account user, I&amp;rsquo;ve never done torrenting or any other heavy usage on their servers. It is not moral even though the provider allows me to.
Probably because of my account was old enough so that my country selection feature wasn&amp;rsquo;t banned until latest update.</description>

      <title>USB Tethering a Portable Router into a Mobile WiFi Hotspot</title>

      <description>Recently I came down to want a mobile hotspot when going out of home, something like Netgear Nighthawk M series, but able to flash custom firmware (OpenWrt/pfSense equivalents) and cheap. However, there is no such thing on the market even without budget consideration.
So it has to be done with DIY, like USB tethering with a router. In the case of tethering or so called Ethernet over USB, we are using a phone as a cellular modem for our router.</description>

      <description>RustDesk is my favorite remote desktop tool which is the best alternative to any closed-source solutions, such as TeamViewer and Anydesk. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda like Bitwarden in the post-breach era of the cloud password manager (LastPass/1Password) market.
As a light user of RustDesk, I use it only occasionally. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t setup my own RD server on VPS even though I suppose to.
For some reason, one of my RustDesk client got blocked to the official servers.</description>

      <description>Recently, I encountered a scrolling problem on ChatGPT web like this. I don&amp;rsquo;t use any userscript or extensions for OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s products and this problem occors in my unhardened Chrome based browser which I do not want to switch from.
Based on the workaround in the threads, I made an userscript out of it which solves the problem by running in tampermonkey.
(function () { document.querySelectorAll(&amp;#39;html *&amp;#39;).forEach(function(node) { var s = getComputedStyle(node); if (s[&amp;#39;overflow&amp;#39;] === &amp;#39;hidden&amp;#39;) { node.</description>

      <description>the &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo; Mark Zuckerberg has been hated by Richard Stallman for decades and he is the only person who appears on both cover image of the video essays: How the Internet was Stolen and How AI was Stolen by Then &amp;amp; Now.
However, things has changed recently after his adoption of the Fediverse and open-sourcing of Llama continuously.
In Zuckerberg&amp;rsquo;s latest &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo;, he stated 5 needs of open-source:</description>

      <description>AI-Generated content can be fun or &amp;ldquo;slop&amp;rdquo; according to Simon Willison, but also can be malevolent due to its abuse in phishing attacks.
Some of my readers may have already known that recently I&amp;rsquo;m working on a side project , which based onchatgpt-html and uses LLMs to detect phishing emails. I think at some point, the tool should be able to detect phishing attempt from video content too. Because deepfake technology is so accessible nowadays and its generated content can be quite convincing.</description>

      <description>2024 Update MrChromebox.tech had a major update a few month ago, so I decide to move on as well.
But before that, use Clonezilla or rsync -aHAXS to back up the 32 GB emmc first.
Run in terminal, install &amp;ldquo;Full UEFI Firmware&amp;rdquo; cd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo bash firmware-util.sh
After reboot, a full version of coreboot is installed, by replacing the previous SeaBIOS which is partial and limited.
This makes this laptop now with a free firmware.</description>

      <description>Last year, I bought a Metro locked Oneplus Nord N30 5G (CPH2513/CPH2515) for $60 during a very slick deal.
However, this phone was completely unusable due to it is haunted with tons of bloatware and spyware. So I decided to let it sit in a drawer for 180 days and then see what I can do with it.
A few days ago, I unlocked it by simply go to About Phone then click Unlock.</description>

      <description>A Deep Dive into Voice Cloning with SoftVC VITS and Bert-VITS2 In the previous post, I have tried a little bit of TTS Generation WebUI and found it&amp;rsquo;s interesting. So, I decide to train a usable model with my own voice.
This voice cloning project explores both SVC for Voice Changing and VITS for Text-to-Speech. There is no one tool does all jobs.
I have tested several tools for this project.</description>

      <description>Cheapskate&amp;rsquo;s NAS Migration from Unraid to Openmediavault For decades, I come across a lot of abandoned computers and recycled parts out of them.
This article is about the recycled Dell Vostro 220s with LGA771 to LGA775 Mod I mentioned in the last post.
It was running Unraid with a low power Xeon L5410 and 2 GB of RAM for many years. The only repair was a PSU replacement two years ago.</description>

      <description>Old Stories The computer hardware used to be more playful and worth tinkering. My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.
Back in the days, I used to repair people&amp;rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it. Then, I bought a cheap E3-1245 and GTX 750 Ti to make it a gaming rig.</description>

      <description>Background Story Last week, I experienced a major data loss on my daily driver computer due to encryption failure. Last time I had encountered this sort of situation was over a decade ago with TrueCrypt on an external HDD and unfortunately lost everything that weren&amp;rsquo;t backed up. I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered everything from backup this time so I decide to document it.
The entire storage on my daily driver is encrypted with LUKS and it suddenly fails on boot decryption.</description>

      <description>I use Generate-subtitles as an alternative or substitute to YouTube closed captions (CC) since it does not always work as expected.
When creating video contents, it comes very handy to have a high quality generated transcripts to start with. My favorite tools are Subtitle Edit and Aegisub. SE provides a great online version and works with .SRT format which fits great into my Adobe Premiere Pro workflow. It also has built-in Auto Translation and Whisper support.</description>

      <description>The latest news updated on waylaidwanderer&amp;rsquo;s repo says:
2023-02-15 The method we were using to access the ChatGPT raw models has been patched, unfortunately.
Therefore, the party is over. It was fun to play with those leaked models such as text-davinci-002-render, text-chat-davinci-002-20221122, and text-chat-davinci-002-sh-alpha-aoruigiofdj83. They&amp;rsquo;re not as good as the official model text-davinci-003 after all as my previous post said.
Why use API instead of the Ordinary Way After OpenAI fired up their paid subscription for ChatGPT, availability issue like response error, rate limit and throttling become more often.</description>

      <description>The Original Flavors In OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s documentation there are 4 models under GPT-3 category and 2 coding models. They cost from $0.02 to $0.0004 per 1k tokens as the base model and the fine-tuned versions cost even more.
text-davinci-003 text-curie-001 text-babbage-001 text-ada-001 code-davinci-002 code-cushman-001 The playground can test them all using the web interface.

Back in time, I was a big fun of Motorola Milestone/Droid series and my main phone was the last of these QWERTY phones, Photon Q (XT897). Its keyboard was fantastic and CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4 KitKat) with XPosed framework was perfect in both productivity and aesthetics.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this pentesting system since early BackTrack era but never felt it ought to be installed on a hard drive.
The graphic installer is much simpler than Parrot OS that may not be an issue for most people.</description>

      <description>Back to the Command-line For some reason, MS Edge for Linux does not have the Read Aloud feature which is the only reason I would like to use Edge. The TTS engine made by Microsoft sounds incomparable to those poorly made chrome extensions.
Therefore, I found a work around with edge-tts. This is a CLI tool uses Edge TTS service. The instruction on its Github repo is very good.
After installation, use edge-tts --list-voices | grep US to show English speaking characters and now I can locate a text file in the terminal to be read.</description>

      <description>Acceleration During my teenage years, I was really into FPS and RTS games. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m kind of picky on computer mouses and being paranoid of acceleration in the OS.
Permanently disabling acceleration for Windows is simple. Besides unchecking the &amp;ldquo;Enhance pointer precision&amp;rdquo; in the main.cpl, some registry hacks such as the good old classic &amp;ldquo;CPL Mouse Fix&amp;rdquo; or the later &amp;ldquo;MarkC&amp;rdquo; would do it easily by a REG/batch file. It is also possible doing manually if you want.</description>

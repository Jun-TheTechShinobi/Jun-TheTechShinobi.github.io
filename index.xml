      <description>Back to the Command-line For some reason, MS Edge for Linux does not have the Read Aloud feature which is the only reason I would like to use Edge. The TTS engine made by Microsoft sounds incomparable to those poorly made chrome extensions.
Therefore, I found a work around with edge-tts. This is a CLI tool uses Edge TTS service. The instruction on its Github repo is very good.
After installation, use edge-tts --list-voices | grep US to show English speaking characters and now I can locate a text file in the terminal to be read.</description>

      <description>Acceleration During my teenage years, I was really into FPS and RTS games. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m kind of picky on computer mouses and being paranoid of acceleration in the OS.
Permanently disabling acceleration for Windows is simple. Besides unchecking the &amp;ldquo;Enhance pointer precision&amp;rdquo; in the main.cpl, some registry hacks such as the good old classic &amp;ldquo;CPL Mouse Fix&amp;rdquo; or the later &amp;ldquo;MarkC&amp;rdquo; would do it easily by a REG/batch file. It is also possible doing manually if you want.</description>

      <title>Little Things Behind This Website</title>

      <description>This is my 2nd time using HUGO and hosting a site on Github Pages. It&amp;rsquo;s so convenient compare to self hosting. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to set up DDNS or CDN, also not have to patch up or update everything periodically to keep it secure.
All the steps I have done are very similar to this article, except making the Personal Access Token and Custom Domain (these are easy to find separately).</description>

      <description>In This Day and Age? Back then, when MySpace and 000webhost was the thing. I wrote blog regularly about my life and hobby. That was the beginning of my Internet journey and tweaking CSS code while posting an article was fun.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to post my stuff on somewhere like mastodon or telegram channel but here I am. Because I feel most comfortable this way.
Dilemma of Giving Back The beginning of my Linux journey was with some early version of OpenWrt and BackTrack, then Puppy and Ubuntu.</description>

      <title>Dealing with the Enshittification of ProtonVPN&#39;s Free Plan (WireGuard&#43;NextDNS)</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/proton-shit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is originally composed on 2024-11-28. I&amp;rsquo;m updating it for combining NextDNS, since I have started using a new freemium app with nasty ADs in it. ProtonVPN&amp;rsquo;s free plan doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to configure AD blocking DNS, especially with their official app. But with WireGuard app, this can be trivial. Thank to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/ProtonVPN/comments/15x7q1q/guide_nextdns_proton_vpn_wireguard_doh3_on_ios&#34;&gt;original guide on reddit&lt;/a&gt;, the newly added part is in the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a early adopter of Protonmail, I use their later coming VPN product as well, regularly yet lightly. Although I&amp;rsquo;m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrating VMs from ESXi to Proxmox VE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why I&amp;rsquo;m doing this. In the days when Virtual Machine was the thing, VMware Workstation was the go-to option for a Windows host to run VMs. We have to find cracked version for personal use, since there was no VirtualBox neither Hyper-V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when I first decided to have a proper homelab in my household, I went blindly into ESXi just because VMware Workstation has already installed on all of my computers. Although I was pretty like Proxmox during that time, it was considered for not so serious projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Upgrading/Fixing Cheapskate&#39;s AI Server</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/upgrade-ai-server/upgrade-ai-server/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/posts/cheapai/&#34;&gt;the server I build back in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, based on a moded Dell Optiplex 3010 SFF motherboard with i5-2300 and Tesla M40. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning to put an Xeon E3 back then but something happened which changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After approximately 1.5 years of 24/7 running, my CPU power extension cable melted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;meltdown1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jun-TheTechShinobi/Jun-TheTechShinobi.github.io/45b89958caec4b3d2293d63c214ec871a2331a1e/posts/upgrade-ai-server/images/meltdown1.JPG&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;meltdown2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jun-TheTechShinobi/Jun-TheTechShinobi.github.io/45b89958caec4b3d2293d63c214ec871a2331a1e/posts/upgrade-ai-server/images/meltdown2.JPG&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just like the PCIe to EPS adapter situation &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/posts/cheapai/#about-power-supply&#34;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, so I have to replace it with a heavier gauge (something better than the cheapest like above).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On iPhone, Design and Jailbreak</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/on-iphone/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;iphone-talks&#34;&gt;iPhone Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a many cellphones that make me feel nostalgic. None of them is Android nor iPhone. Some of them are &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/posts/pmos/&#34;&gt;QWERTY&lt;/a&gt;, some are flip phones. Phones were much interesting back in the days when Motorola, Nokia, Sony, Sharp, Blackberry and more are still competitive in the market. Today&amp;rsquo;s smartphones are indifferent and rather being &amp;ldquo;boredphones&amp;rdquo;. And all of these boredness are rooted in the &amp;ldquo;iPhone Moment&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite how much I dislike iPhone&amp;rsquo;s disruptive innovation and its market breakthrough as well as Apple&amp;rsquo;s philosophy behind it. There is one thing true about the spirit of Steve Jobs, that is, a phone should be comfortably used in one hand. Although this was his defense of iPhone&amp;rsquo;s 3.5 inch screen size, I strongly agree with his ergonomics minded UX design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reviving ThinkCentre M58p in 2024</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/m58p/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Days before mini-PC become a thing, there was no NUC, MinisForum or Beelink. It was the time of thin client and SFF (small-form-factor), manufacturers such as Shuttle, Dell and Lenovo were made a lot of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, the performance of SoC was too weak so that even laptops wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use them. But my first dedicated home lab machine was an Atom D525, which was called embedded industrial computer. It served as a router rather than server due to its performance and heat. That was also the time when I got into the world of m0n0wall derivatives (pfSense/FreeNAS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Windows Nostalgia, Linux and Its Discontents</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/11-7-linux/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows-nostalgia&#34;&gt;Windows Nostalgia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent video on Windows 7 as daily driver OS by &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/RE08P0iqCzY&#34;&gt;Brodie Robertson&lt;/a&gt; was hilarious but also arguable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, XP is the best OS ever made by M$. However, it has became not so useful nowadays neither for retro gaming (which 98SE is the king) nor for day-to-day usage, due to both hardware and software incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise would be Windows 7. I agree there are too much of accumulated unpatched security vulnerabilities, but there are tricks to mitigate most of those either technically or strategically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ethics of Local LLMs: A Response to Zuckerberg&#39;s &#39;&#39;Open Source AI Manifesto&#39;&#39;</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/ethics-llm/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-open-source-ai-manifesto&#34;&gt;the &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/facebook.html&#34;&gt;hated by Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; for decades and he is the only person who appears on both cover image of the video essays: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/oLLxpAZzy0s&#34;&gt;How the Internet was Stolen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/BQTXv5jm6s4&#34;&gt;How AI was Stolen&lt;/a&gt; by Then &amp;amp; Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things has changed recently after his adoption of the Fediverse and &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/lJ_NRIKbRKc&#34;&gt;open-sourcing of Llama&lt;/a&gt; continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/&#34;&gt;Zuckerberg&amp;rsquo;s latest &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, he stated 5 needs of open-source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to train, fine-tune, and distill our own models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to control our own destiny and not get locked into a closed vendor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to protect our data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need a model that is efficient and affordable to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to invest in the ecosystem thatâ€™s going to be the standard for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That describes the needs of tech individuals and small businesses accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the text for a lecture I&amp;rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielabaron.me/blog/build-and-publish-presentation-with-html-and-css/&#34;&gt;Daniela Baron&amp;rsquo;s guide&lt;/a&gt; which helped me tremendously for creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/AI-CyberSec-PH-presentation/&#34;&gt;the slides&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/&#34;&gt;RevealJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Well, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if anyone is interested in that direction, but I digressed, let&amp;rsquo;s get to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;0x00-before-start&#34;&gt;0x00 Before Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I just gave my iPhone 4S away. This phone runs smoothly with jailbreak iOS 6.1.3. It was siting in my nostalgia box for years and has never been my daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in time, I was a big fun of Motorola Milestone/Droid series and my main phone was the last of these QWERTY phones, Photon Q (XT897). Its keyboard was fantastic and CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4 KitKat) with XPosed framework was perfect in both productivity and aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

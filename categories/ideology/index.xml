      <description>Windows Nostalgia A recent video on Windows 7 as daily driver OS by Brodie Robertson was hilarious but also arguable.
For me, XP is the best OS ever made by M$. However, it has became not so useful nowadays neither for retro gaming (which 98SE is the king) nor for day-to-day usage, due to both hardware and software incompatibility.
The compromise would be Windows 7. I agree there are too much of accumulated unpatched security vulnerabilities, but there are tricks to mitigate most of those either technically or strategically.</description>

      <description>As a early adopter of Protonmail, I use their later coming VPN product as well, regularly yet lightly. Although I&amp;rsquo;m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.
Being a free account user, I&amp;rsquo;ve never done torrenting or any other heavy usage on their servers. It is not moral even though the provider allows me to.
Probably because of my account was old enough so that my country selection feature wasn&amp;rsquo;t banned until latest update.</description>

      <description>This is the text for a lecture I&amp;rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for Daniela Baron&amp;rsquo;s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.

      <description>0x00 Before Start Recently, I just gave my iPhone 4S away. This phone runs smoothly with jailbreak iOS 6.1.3. It was siting in my nostalgia box for years and has never been my daily driver.
Back in time, I was a big fun of Motorola Milestone/Droid series and my main phone was the last of these QWERTY phones, Photon Q (XT897). Its keyboard was fantastic and CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4 KitKat) with XPosed framework was perfect in both productivity and aesthetics.</description>

      <description>This is the text for a lecture I&amp;rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for Daniela Baron&amp;rsquo;s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.
Hey everyone. Okay, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.</description>

      <description>Podcast doesn&amp;rsquo;t fetch I have multiple devices that are using different URL based filter methods. Some are at the router level and some are at the system level, e.g., Hosts file, DNS and VPN built-in.
Recently, I found out there is a broken one in my podcast subscriptions.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time not listening to the podcast, Startups For the Rest of Us, since I started following Rob Walling&amp;rsquo;s new show called MicroConf.</description>

      <description>Recently, I got a new ThinkPad which took Lenovo over 2 month preparing for shipping. For the price, it worth waiting. This is the first Chromebook I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had, so I did quite a lot experiments with it.
Hardware The model is C13 Yoga Chromebook (MORPHIUS) with AMD Athlon gold 3015c (Picasso) 4GB RAM and 32GB eMMc storage.
There are multiple variations in C13 models and mine is the lowest-end of them.</description>

      <description>Kali Linux &amp;amp; FreshTomato Parrot OS was on my old ThinkPad for many years. I recently upgraded it and had some issue with my multi-bootloader. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not Parrot OS&amp;rsquo;s fault, I switched to Kali Linux as a workaround.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this pentesting system since early BackTrack era but never felt it ought to be installed on a hard drive.
The graphic installer is much simpler than Parrot OS that may not be an issue for most people.</description>

      <title>Little Things Behind This Website</title>

      <description>#aliases: [&amp;ldquo;standby&amp;rdquo;] This is my 2nd time using HUGO and hosting a site on Github Pages. It&amp;rsquo;s so convenient compare to self hosting. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to set up DDNS or CDN, also not have to patch up or update everything periodically to keep it secure.
All the steps I have done are very similar to this article, except making the Personal Access Token and Custom Domain (these are easy to find separately).</description>

      <title>Cheapskate&#39;s TrueNAS Build with 6 Drives RAID-Z2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After almost two years later, the hardware of &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/posts/cheapnas/#old-stories&#34;&gt;my Openmediavault NAS&lt;/a&gt; is going to be upgraded from Vostro to Precision. Which is a big leap, that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do any hardware modification to use Xeon CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for my friend&amp;rsquo;s donation. This junkstation comes with E3-1245, 16GB and 4 SATA HDD port. What I added is a ASMedia 106x SATA PCIE card for 2 more SATA HDD capacity (6 HDD in total), and a PCIe to NVMe adapter for accommodating a
OS drive (128GB SSD).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flashing DD-WRT into a Linksys MR7350 with Basic Hardening</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since my WiFi is getting more and more unstable, and I finally decided to retire my NETGEAR R6300v2 which has served me well since in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in used condition when I bought it, so this is a good time to get a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the ISPs in my area are very bad, I still have to stick with the low speed Internet for probably quite some time. So I decided to buy a used &lt;a href=&#34;https://wikidevi.wi-cat.ru/Linksys_MR7350&#34;&gt;Linksys MR7350&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making N100 mini-PC into a pfSense Box</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/n100pfsense/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I was a teenager, I have started voluntarily helping people around me with my skill of technology. This time, I&amp;rsquo;m helping someone to build up a robust, secure and cost-effective firewall/gateway/soft router at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ends up on a $100 worth N100 mini-pc with dual Ethernet port, which can be a great pfSense box for home or even business use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware-tweaks&#34;&gt;Hardware Tweaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model (T8PLUS) secured with 4 screws at outside, after removing them the outer case can be easily pried open (just a little bit more effort than Intel NUCs), and removing 4 more screws inside to get the access of the motherboard (way more simpler design of the power button comparing to NUCs).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

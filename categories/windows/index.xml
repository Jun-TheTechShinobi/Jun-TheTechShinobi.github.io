      <description>Windows Nostalgia A recent video on Windows 7 as daily driver OS by Brodie Robertson was hilarious but also arguable.
For me, XP is the best OS ever made by M$. However, it has became not so useful nowadays neither for retro gaming (which 98SE is the king) nor for day-to-day usage, due to both hardware and software incompatibility.
The compromise would be Windows 7. I agree there are too much of accumulated unpatched security vulnerabilities, but there are tricks to mitigate most of those either technically or strategically.</description>

      <description>2024 Update MrChromebox.tech had a major update a few month ago, so I decide to move on as well.
But before that, use Clonezilla or rsync -aHAXS to back up the 32 GB emmc first.
Run in terminal, install &amp;ldquo;Full UEFI Firmware&amp;rdquo; cd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo bash firmware-util.sh
After reboot, a full version of coreboot is installed, by replacing the previous SeaBIOS which is partial and limited.
This makes this laptop now with a free firmware.</description>

      <description>As a lifelong self-learner, I use all sorts of methods to learn new things, and AI is what I&amp;rsquo;m currently into. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the game since 2022, my background wasn&amp;rsquo;t focused on AI. So, like everyone else, I had to do some &amp;ldquo;AI For Dummies&amp;rdquo; level study in order to get more involved. Below is a list of learning materials that I find very helpful for myself to get started with and might also be helpful for someone else in the same situation.</description>

      <title>Dealing with the Enshittification of Proton VPN on Free Plan&#39;s Server Selection</title>

      <description>As a early adopter of Protonmail, I use their later coming VPN product as well, regularly yet lightly. Although I&amp;rsquo;m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.
Being a free account user, I&amp;rsquo;ve never done torrenting or any other heavy usage on their servers. It is not moral even though the provider allows me to.
Probably because of my account was old enough so that my country selection feature wasn&amp;rsquo;t banned until latest update.</description>

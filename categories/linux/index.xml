      <description>Old Stories The computer hardware used to be more playful and worth tinkering. My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.
Back in the days, I used to repair people&amp;rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it. Then, I bought a cheap E3-1245 and GTX 750 Ti to make it a gaming rig.</description>

      <description>Background Story Last week, I experienced a major data loss on my daily driver computer due to encryption failure. Last time I had encountered this sort of situation was over a decade ago with TrueCrypt on an external HDD and unfortunately lost everything that weren&amp;rsquo;t backed up. I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered everything from backup this time so I decide to document it.
The entire storage on my daily driver is encrypted with LUKS and it suddenly fails on boot decryption.</description>

      <description>I use Generate-subtitles  as an alternative or substitute to YouTube closed captions (CC) since it does not always work as expected.
When creating video contents, it comes very handy to have a high quality generated transcripts to start with. My favorite tools are Subtitle Edit and Aegisub. SE provides a great online version and works with .SRT format which fits great into my Adobe Premiere Pro workflow. It also has built-in Auto Translation and Whisper support.</description>

      <description>No DALL-E, No Midjourney and No Colab This is a guide showing how to build your own stable diffusion server on what you already have or cheap used hardwares. It may not satisfy for a serious production use but pretty viable for learning, testing or casual use.
Before we start, here&amp;rsquo;s some comments on OpenAI:

      <description>Recently, I got a new ThinkPad which took Lenovo over 2 month preparing for shipping. For the price, it worth waiting. This is the first Chromebook I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had, so I did quite a lot experiments with it.
Hardware The model is C13 Yoga Chromebook (MORPHIUS) with AMD Athlon gold 3015c (Picasso) 4GB RAM and 32GB eMMc storage.
There are multiple variations in C13 models and mine is the lowest-end of them.</description>

      <description>0x00 Before Start Recently, I just gave my iPhone 4S away. This phone runs smoothly with jailbreak iOS 6.1.3. It was siting in my nostalgia box for years and has never been my daily driver.
Back in time, I was a big fun of Motorola Milestone/Droid series and my main phone was the last of these QWERTY phones, Photon Q (XT897). Its keyboard was fantastic and CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4 KitKat) with XPosed framework was perfect in both productivity and aesthetics.</description>

      <description>Kali Linux &amp;amp; FreshTomato Parrot OS was on my old ThinkPad for many years. I recently upgraded it and had some issue with my multi-bootloader. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not Parrot OS&amp;rsquo;s fault, I switched to Kali Linux as a workaround.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this pentesting system since early BackTrack era but never felt it ought to be installed on a hard drive.
The graphic installer is much simpler than Parrot OS that may not be an issue for most people.</description>

      <description>Back to the Command-line For some reason, MS Edge for Linux does not have the Read Aloud feature which is the only reason I would like to use Edge. The TTS engine made by Microsoft sounds incomparable to those poorly made chrome extensions.
Therefore, I found a work around with edge-tts. This is a CLI tool uses Edge TTS service. The instruction on its Github repo is very good.
After installation, use edge-tts --list-voices | grep US to show English speaking characters and now I can locate a text file in the terminal to be read.</description>

      <description>Acceleration During my teenage years, I was really into FPS and RTS games. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m kind of picky on computer mouses and being paranoid of acceleration in the OS.
Permanently disabling acceleration for Windows is simple. Besides unchecking the &amp;ldquo;Enhance pointer precision&amp;rdquo; in the main.cpl, some registry hacks such as the good old classic &amp;ldquo;CPL Mouse Fix&amp;rdquo; or the later &amp;ldquo;MarkC&amp;rdquo; would do it easily by a REG/batch file. It is also possible doing manually if you want.</description>

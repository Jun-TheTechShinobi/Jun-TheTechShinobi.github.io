      <description>Lately, there is a need of private chatbot service as a complete alternative to OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT. So, I decide to implement one at home and make it accessible to everyone in my household alongside with my network printer and NAS (OpenMediaVault).
In the past, I used to recommend people using Llama series for English tasks and Qwen series for Chinese tasks. There was no open-source model that&amp;rsquo;s strong enough in multilingual tasks comparing to proprietary ones (GPT/Claude).</description>

      <description>As a lifelong self-learner, I use all sorts of methods to learn new things, and AI is what I&amp;rsquo;m currently into. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the game since 2022, my background wasn&amp;rsquo;t focused on AI. So, like everyone else, I had to do some &amp;ldquo;AI For Dummies&amp;rdquo; level study in order to get more involved. Below is a list of learning materials that I find very helpful for myself to get started with and might also be helpful for someone else in the same situation.</description>

      <description>Recently, I encountered a scrolling problem on ChatGPT web like this. I don&amp;rsquo;t use any userscript or extensions for OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s products and this problem occors in my unhardened Chrome based browser which I do not want to switch from.
Based on the workaround in the threads, I made an userscript out of it which solves the problem by running in tampermonkey.
(function () { document.querySelectorAll(&amp;#39;html *&amp;#39;).forEach(function(node) { var s = getComputedStyle(node); if (s[&amp;#39;overflow&amp;#39;] === &amp;#39;hidden&amp;#39;) { node.</description>

      <description>the &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo; Mark Zuckerberg has been hated by Richard Stallman for decades and he is the only person who appears on both cover image of the video essays: How the Internet was Stolen and How AI was Stolen by Then &amp;amp; Now.
However, things has changed recently after his adoption of the Fediverse and open-sourcing of Llama continuously.
In Zuckerberg&amp;rsquo;s latest &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo;, he stated 5 needs of open-source:</description>

      <description>AI-Generated content can be fun or &amp;ldquo;slop&amp;rdquo; according to Simon Willison, but also can be malevolent due to its abuse in phishing attacks.
Some of my readers may have already known that recently I&amp;rsquo;m working on a side project , which based onchatgpt-html and uses LLMs to detect phishing emails. I think at some point, the tool should be able to detect phishing attempt from video content too. Because deepfake technology is so accessible nowadays and its generated content can be quite convincing.</description>

      <description>A Deep Dive into Voice Cloning with SoftVC VITS and Bert-VITS2 In the previous post, I have tried a little bit of TTS Generation WebUI and found it&amp;rsquo;s interesting. So, I decide to train a usable model with my own voice.
This voice cloning project explores both SVC for Voice Changing and VITS for Text-to-Speech. There is no one tool does all jobs.
I have tested several tools for this project.</description>

      <description>Old Stories The computer hardware used to be more playful and worth tinkering. My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.
Back in the days, I used to repair people&amp;rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it. Then, I bought a cheap E3-1245 and GTX 750 Ti to make it a gaming rig.</description>

      <description>I use Generate-subtitles as an alternative or substitute to YouTube closed captions (CC) since it does not always work as expected.
When creating video contents, it comes very handy to have a high quality generated transcripts to start with. My favorite tools are Subtitle Edit and Aegisub. SE provides a great online version and works with .SRT format which fits great into my Adobe Premiere Pro workflow. It also has built-in Auto Translation and Whisper support.</description>

      <description>This is the text for a lecture I&amp;rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for Daniela Baron&amp;rsquo;s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.
Hey everyone. Well, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.</description>

      <description>No DALL-E, No Midjourney and No Colab This is a guide showing how to build your own stable diffusion server on what you already have or cheap used hardwares. It may not satisfy for a serious production use but pretty viable for learning, testing or casual use.
Before we start, here&amp;rsquo;s some comments on OpenAI:

      <title>Bypassing ChatGPT&#39;s Safeguard and Easiest Way to use API</title>

      <description>The latest news updated on waylaidwanderer&amp;rsquo;s repo says:
2023-02-15 The method we were using to access the ChatGPT raw models has been patched, unfortunately.
Therefore, the party is over. It was fun to play with those leaked models such as text-davinci-002-render, text-chat-davinci-002-20221122, and text-chat-davinci-002-sh-alpha-aoruigiofdj83. They&amp;rsquo;re not as good as the official model text-davinci-003 after all as my previous post said.
Why use API instead of the Ordinary Way After OpenAI fired up their paid subscription for ChatGPT, availability issue like response error, rate limit and throttling become more often.</description>

      <description>The Original Flavors In OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s documentation there are 4 models under GPT-3 category and 2 coding models. They cost from $0.02 to $0.0004 per 1k tokens as the base model and the fine-tuned versions cost even more.
text-davinci-003 text-curie-001 text-babbage-001 text-ada-001 code-davinci-002 code-cushman-001 The playground can test them all using the web interface.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how good they are comparing to the free ChatGPT.

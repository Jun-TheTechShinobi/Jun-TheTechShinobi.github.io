[{"content":"This is my 2nd time using HUGO and hosting a site on Github Pages. It\u0026rsquo;s so convenient compare to self hosting. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to set up DDNS or CDN, also not have to patch up or update everything periodically to keep it secure.\nAll the steps I have done are very similar to this article, except making the Personal Access Token and Custom Domain (these are easy to find separately).\nThe theme I picked up is PaperMod. It is well designed that provides simplicity without sacrificing functionality. However, the Archive and Search feature are not functional by default. Enabling everything I need was quite easy with the wiki manual and the example site as reference.\nPersonalizing the template in the code file is much easier than the WordPress admin dashboard. To respect visitor\u0026rsquo;s privacy and not ruin the user experience with those nasty pop-ups, I disabled all analytics support by putting env: development in the config file.\nI also applied another block of code to ensure all those invaders are suppressed.\nprivacy: disqus: disable: true googleAnalytics: disable: true instagram: disable: true twitter: disable: true vimeo: disable: true youtube: disable: false privacyEnhanced: true The only exception is youtube, since it provides privacy Enhanced feature. What it does is turning the youtube URL into www.youtube-nocookie.com so that makes Google harder to track people inside my website.\nYes, just make a bit it harder. That\u0026rsquo;s why I also provided invidious links as alternative to the youtube video for those who cares about online privacy.\nIn my site, we have no ugly GDPR cookie concent popups because there is no cookie or any sort of tracking at all.\nOne more little thing, the image of the favicon as well as my github profile avatar, that is from a very interesting Japanese swordmanship called \u0026ldquo;Tenshinryu\u0026rdquo;. It is the only traditional school that embraces the Internet and openly share their techniques through video. That\u0026rsquo;s why I like this school.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/little-things-behind/","summary":"This is my 2nd time using HUGO and hosting a site on Github Pages.

Back then, when MySpace and 000webhost was the thing. I wrote blog regularly about my life and hobby. That was the beginning of my Internet journey and tweaking CSS code while posting an article was fun.\nToday, I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to post my stuff on somewhere like mastodon or telegram channel but here I am. Because I feel most comfortable this way.\nDilemma of Giving Back The beginning of my Linux journey was with some early version of OpenWrt and BackTrack, then Puppy and Ubuntu. At this very moment, I\u0026rsquo;m typing with MarkText on a Pop!_OS and all my servers are running on either CentOS or Debian.\nHowever, it was a shame that I have never contribute a single line of code back to the FOSS community at all. I have done a lot of techy nerdy projects in the past but none of those was suitable for the propose.\nOld Motivation New Direction Last month, two talks inspired me deeply.\nThe Homelab Show Episode 50:How To Give Back and Participate In OpenSource Projects     Privacy friendly watch Link:\nhttps://invidious.weblibre.org/watch?v=mxLEwFpsMp8\n  Podcast Link:Â https://thehomelab.show/2022/03/31/the-homelab-show-ep-50-how-to-give-back-and-participate-in-opensource-projects/\n  Privacy, Surveillance \u0026amp; Decentralization Podcast | The Hated One w/ Closed Ntwrk     Privacy friendly watch Link:\nhttps://invidious.weblibre.org/watch?v=3C2z7pViZ4o\n  Podcast Link:\nhttps://www.closedntwrk.com/episode-12-collab-with-the-hated-one-youtube-personality/\n  Both Tom Lawrence and The Hated One are not specialized in coding but they have their very own way to make their contribution back to the community, by putting good information and knowledge on the Internet to help others.\nI think I can do the same, but by writing instead of talking. There are some project notes lying in my Obsidian vault. I wrote them because I found no one else did. The notes might be helpful for someone so I think they are worth to share.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/why-i-started/","summary":"In This Day and Age?

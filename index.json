In the days when Virtual Machine was the thing, VMware Workstation was the go-to option for a Windows host to run VMs. We have to find cracked version for personal use, since there was no VirtualBox neither Hyper-V.\nMany years ago, when I first decided to have a proper homelab in my household, I went blindly into ESXi just because VMware Workstation has already installed on all of my computers. Although I was pretty like Proxmox during that time, it was considered for not so serious projects.\nBecause I was open to sysadmin job during that time, I was not only installing ESXi, but also vSphere all together. I was also using CentOS for most of my Linux VMs and using Fedora as my daily driver to be familiar with RHEL operations.\nBut after time, Proxmox VE and XCP-ng became more attractive to me year by year. Finally, VMware is now Broadcom and ransomware gangs are apparently targeting on this change!\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s due to risk management or FOSS adoption, the goal is to get rid of VMware.

None of them is Android nor iPhone. Some of them are QWERTY, some are flip phones. Phones were much interesting back in the days when Motorola, Nokia, Sony, Sharp, Blackberry and more are still competitive in the market. Today\u0026rsquo;s smartphones are indifferent and rather being \u0026ldquo;boredphones\u0026rdquo;. And all of these boredness are rooted in the \u0026ldquo;iPhone Moment\u0026rdquo;.\nDespite how much I dislike iPhone\u0026rsquo;s disruptive innovation and its market breakthrough as well as Apple\u0026rsquo;s philosophy behind it. There is one thing true about the spirit of Steve Jobs, that is, a phone should be comfortably used in one hand. Although this was his defense of iPhone\u0026rsquo;s 3.5 inch screen size, I strongly agree with his ergonomics minded UX design.\nBut people are very different individually, so there is no universal design fits perfect for everyone. I have medium sized hands and iPhone 4s (3.5\u0026quot;) handles very comfortable for me. But due to all the apps that I use have dropped support of it, I had to switch to a larger iPhone.\niPhone SE 1st gen (4.0\u0026quot;) is what I\u0026rsquo;ve been using since then. Its size is not as comfortable but still can be handled in most posture. This is the maxim size I could prefer for an iPhone. The later SE models (4.7\u0026quot;) are too large, and the \u0026ldquo;mini\u0026rdquo; model (5.4\u0026quot;) and latest SE 4th gen (6.1\u0026quot;) look like a joke to me.\nBut wait! Why I have no problem with my Pixel and OnePlus? Because I treat them as PDA and Pocket PC, or in more modern term, phablet. These mobile devices are supposed to be used with both hands. Although I would consider older Nexus (prior to 5) as phones.\nBack to iPhone talks. Recently I moved all my close-sourced apps to my iPhone SE and decide to leave my Android phone completely with open-source ecosystem. This leads to a purposefully designed problem, of course by Apple.\nMy phone use cases are very limited, no matter which OS, usually less than 10 apps are installed by me. As wrote in recent post, I heavily rely on RSS feeds to receive information, either through podcasts or news.\nOn Android, my favorite reader is Feeder and player is AntennaPod. They both support OPML import/export as my core needs, but neither of them is on iOS.\nThis is not a problem if I\u0026rsquo;m a regular user with a well-supported iPhone. But I\u0026rsquo;m clearly not. The best alternatives on iOS are Anytime Podcast Player and NetNewsWire, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t install NetNewsWire. App Store sets it \u0026ldquo;Requires iOS 17.0 or later\u0026rdquo; even though the project\u0026rsquo;s website states \u0026ldquo;For iOS 13 and newer\u0026rdquo; (SE 1st gen stucks at iOS 15.8.3).\nSo, I need some justice to take back my rights and freedom to own and use my iPhone. Unfortunately, AltStore still has too much restrictions by Apple. This company is trolling the entire world too much so I have to troll it back in a much troller sense.\nJailbreak with palera1n The installation is very simple. I choose to use ISO version since this is a one-time use tool. I just downloaded the ISO file and instead of flashing with Etcher I simply put it on a Ventoy drive.\nAfter the ISO booted, I used 1 palera1n with Rootless option and then 1 Start. By following the instruction on screen, the phone would enter DFU mode and finish the job automatically.\nWhen it rebooted back to normal with an extra app palera1n, playing with package managers such as Sileo and Zebra may be interesting, but this is not what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.\nSideloadly \u0026amp; TrollStore For using Sideloadly, I choose to use my Hackintosh on a ThinkPad due to hassle of Windows. Using Hackintosh is much easier nowadays thanks to OpenCore. Whatever the platform is, baremetal, virtualbox, KVM, Proxmox, or even docker is possible to run Mac OS.\nAfter installing SideloadlySetup.dmg, I connected my iPhone via USB and it detects as expected. Then, I had to login both my iTunes and Sideloadly with same account and make it trusted developer through Settings -\u0026gt; General -\u0026gt; Profiles/VPN \u0026amp; Device Management in order to install TrollInstallerX.ipa.\nUsing TrollInstallerX to install TrollStore and it\u0026rsquo;s now ready to install all sorts of IPAs. But due to the trolling of Apple, both AppStore++ and ipatool have became unusable. The latest working tool is MuffinStore and it works like a charm.\nMuffinStore On iPhone, I used safari to download MuffinStore_v1.1.tipa and opened it with TrollStore to install the package. Open MuffinStore, I can see and up or downgrade any installed apps, but what I need is to tap the Download option.\nPaste the App Store link of NetNewsWire in there, and pull the version ID list from server. I selected the latest one and I finally could make purchase of the app. It showed Download an older version of this app but this is exactly what I wanted and couldn\u0026rsquo;t get without jailbreaking.\nAfterall, the installed version is NetNewsWire 6.1.4 (Build 6120). It works as expected and worth the time and effort to get.\nThe jailbreak process is a little bit long and not well documented. So, as a disclaimer, I decide to write this as my own record for lookup in the future. I\u0026rsquo;m not responsible for anyone else trolling Apple after reading this post. Don\u0026rsquo;t troll on me because of that.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/on-iphone/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"iphone-talks\"\u003eiPhone Talks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a many cellphones that make me feel nostalgic.

It was the time of thin client and SFF (small-form-factor), manufacturers such as Shuttle, Dell and Lenovo were made a lot of these.\nBack then, the performance of SoC was too weak so that even laptops wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use them. But my first dedicated home lab machine was an Atom D525, which was called embedded industrial computer. It served as a router rather than server due to its performance and heat. That was also the time when I got into the world of m0n0wall derivatives (pfSense/FreeNAS).\nOur main story today is ThinkCentre M58p, an SFF made in 2008 with a relatively decent CPU (Core2 Duo E8400) during its time. Originally, I picked up this machine at Goodwill many years ago for $15. It was used as a pfSense box and then IP cam recorder for a few years.\nIt was quite reliable and low maintenance but the only drawback was power consumption. So, after I moved to somewhere I need to pay for the electricity, it was been replaced by something more efficient.\nFor today\u0026rsquo;s application, it is not powerful enough for even the most basic internet surfing, especially for a dual monitor multi-tasking setup. So I need to upgrade it for the job.\nFor storage, it only has SATA2 ports which means bottleneck for 550/520 Mbps SSDs (3Gb/s instead of 6Gb/s). I used my SATA3 drive anyway because I don\u0026rsquo;t have other spares.\nInterestingly, it is technically a desktop but receives laptop RAM sticks (SO-DIMM). Because I have many spare ones for it, it was easily beefed up to 8GB of RAM.\nNext is connectivity. Wireless driver is always a pain in the ass for Linux environment, thanks for this list which tells every USB WiFi adapters that would work out-of-box. So I ordered a dirt cheap MT7601 for this upgrade.\nThe last and the most complex step is the CPU. As people discussed in the TP forum, the higher end consumer grade CPUs are always overpriced even in the used market after a decade! And those are not good for SFF configuration due to their TDP (requires more cooling and power). So, doing a Xeon Mod is almost the go-to for a cost-effective upgrade, and this is my second time doing the 771 to 775 route.\nSpeaking of cost-effective, spending more money than its selling price on an outdated but not vintage computer isn\u0026rsquo;t something recommended. But it\u0026rsquo;s not cool to generate e-waste in my book, so let\u0026rsquo;s get start.\nDownload bios file and flash tool then extract both.\nRun WinPhlash on a Windows environment, browse to $image5C.usf, uncheck both Flash only if xxx options in Advanced Settings, then Flash BIOS.\nFollow this instruction to apply the sticker and cut off the CPU guides. A precision cutter or simply utility knife would do it, then clean up the residues with tweezers and soft brush. Then, install the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; x3363 and put enough amount of thermal paste.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to power it up. The old 90W PSU (19V 4.74A) is still adequate for its duty and there is no extra settings needed in the BIOS nor Linux. This Xeon x3363 runs so cool and quite, 55C at idle and 89C under full load. But its performance is very satisfying, that everything (Firefox multiple tabs, FreeTube playing 720P and instant messenger simultaneously) just runs as fast as a modern desktop should be.\nFor now, it has returned into a decent internet surfing machine once again. But there are empty slots such as a PCI and two SATA ready for specialized tasks. Perhaps, this would not the last time I\u0026rsquo;m writing about this machine\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/m58p/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDays before mini-PC become a thing, there was no NUC, MinisForum or Beelink.

As a free and open source provocateur, I use Linux on my old and new hardware. But when installing OS for non-tech-savvy people, most of time, Windows is my only option. Nevertheless, I often install and recommend open source tools on Windows platform for them.\nDuring Windows 8 to 10 LTSB period, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so interested into installing the latest Windows. However, when M$ decide to block hardware in their installer either via TPM or CPU generations, I started installing later version of Windows just for bypassing the restrictions.\nEven though it is very exciting to see the first Windows 11 LTSC releasing. The recent 24H2 update causes tons of problems, and the one affects me is that SSE4.2 instruction requirement for 24H2 (build 26080) is un-bypassable.\nSo for old CPUs such as Core 2 Duo (Penryn/Wolfdale) which needs to run Windows, either stuck with Windows 11 23H2 or better off use Windows 10 LTSC 2021(21H2). No Windows 11 LTSC for these machines sadly.\nWindows 11 LTSC Double Debloat But for later hardware that is supported (Nehalem/Sandy Bridge/Haswell), a debloated Windows 11 LTSC is nice to try out (Yes, even with LTSC, a double debloating is needed on old hardware).\nHowever, among the community, folks predominantly talk down all pre-debloated custom build for security concerns (spyware/rootkit), despite the fact that the most vicious yet undetectable malware is Windows it self.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not against people who choose to use \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; official ISOs from M$ no matter what in it (for example Recall/Copilot). But I prefer some middle ground in between to get all benefit of both clean and debloat altogether.\nThere are two ways to archive this goal, either do a pre-install debloat via tiny11builder, or post-install debloat via Win11Debloat. Of course, there are many other alternatives but these are easy and with highest stars on GitHub. I can also do both in one installation.\nFirst, download Windows 11 LTSC from MAS\nOn a Windows 10 (full version) machine, mount the ISO.\nExtract tiny11builder\nIn a PowerShell with admin, run Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted\nRun tiny11maker.ps1 in the PowerShell.\nFollow the instruction and input answers when prompted. Using Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC (index 2) is recommended.\nRename the finished tiny11.iso into tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.iso\nInstall it with Rufus or Ventoy without internet\nNote: The ISO made with tiny11Coremaker.ps1 removed too many drivers, so that the built-in installer wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work on some hardware (stack at driver selection). Use tools like WinNTSetup to install with install.esd file directly.\nExtract Win11Debloat and execute Run.bat\nConnect to internet, open a PowerShell with admin, run activation script also from MAS irm https://get.activated.win | iex\nDownload WinGet, extract DesktopAppInstaller_Dependencies.zip and install with PowerShell:\nAdd-AppxPackage Microsoft.UI.Xaml.2.8_8.2310.30001.0_x64.appx Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00.UWPDesktop_14.0.33728.0_x64.appx Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.msixbundle Even though there are a lot more to do if I want to go deep into that rabbit hole (e.g. privacy.sexy, Harden Windows Security and O\u0026amp;O ShutUp10++), but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to spend that effort on my Linux build (or Windows 7). Because no matter how much I modify this Windows 11, it is fundamentally controlled by M$, who is able to alter the system anytime and destroy all my effort like a sand castle.\nAfter all, the best way to maintain a computer timelessly is using Linux. We\u0026rsquo;re living in the reactionary era, and the whole world is moving backwards. The only way to preserve the spark of progress is to stay old-school. This may looks like conservative, but it is radical in its essence.\nTiny 11 LTSC WTG on Ventoy For most of the time, when I using public computers, Linux livecd and Windows PE are sufficient for the use case. However, when I work in my university\u0026rsquo;s AI lab, I need another solution.\nThe IT controlled lab machines are too restricted for some of my projects, so having a portable OS in a USB drive is a way around for using their expensive GPU with total control of the system.\nWindows To Go tricks often done by rufus after the official Windows To Go discontinued, and this time, let\u0026rsquo;s try to combine it with Ventoy for more flexibility.\nDownload and extract Ventoy, in my case, using ventoy-1.0.99-linux.tar.gz\nInsert desired USB drive, in my case, it is a Netac U335S (cheap and with hardware write protection), and use Ventoy2Disk gui to make it into bootable drive in GPT mode.\nBy default, the storage partition is exfat, it needs to be formatted into NTFS via partitioning tools such as GParted. (Note: windows version of ventoy2disk is able to create NTFS partition directly in the partition configuration.)\nThen, follow the instruction for Windows VHD Boot Plugin, create a folder and put the img file inside the Ventoy drive, as /ventoy/ventoy_vhdboot.img.\nEject and insert the Ventoy USB drive on a Windows machine.\nCreate a VHD file via diskmgmt.msc - Action - Create VHD, set the file designation on the Ventoy USB drive with name tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.vhd, and set 32GB of fixed disk size.\n(Note: the initial C drive size would be around 10GB, so 16GB is minimum for testing use. For frequent use, 128GB drive size on a portable SSD is optimal.)\nOpen rufus, select the newly created VHD as device, browse to previously created tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.iso as the image file, and install with the option Windows To Go.\n(Note: This tiny11 build is 24h2 which incompatible with older CPUs, but I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in using them.)\nWhen it finishes, open VirtualBox and create a new Windows 11 VM with EFI on and the VHD file as existing hard drive.\nBoot the VM and shutdown it when OOBE language selection menu shows up. Now the VHD file is ready, it\u0026rsquo;s time to boot it up on the bare metal!\n(Note: for troubleshooting, refer to meilon, midas and KBHost)\nIt is even better to have a similar Ventoy VDI for Linux. Their instruction is very detailed and easy, so I don\u0026rsquo;t need to repeat it here.\nRecommendations for Flash Drive (may not apply to SSD/HDD):\nWTG/LiveUSB is particular fragile while tweaking/debloating or installing random drivers, so keep copies of VHD/VDI files before every major changes. Disable \u0026ldquo;Temporary paging file was created\u0026rdquo; notification at every boot: run regedit, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management set TempPageFile to 0 Disable Prefetch/Superfetch to gain I/O performance and NAND longevity: from the same registry key above, open PrefetchParameters and set both EnablePrefetcher and EnableSuperfetcher to 0 Disable other background I/O intensive services for same reason, such as Windows search, Windows Update, SysMain, Windows Security Service, Windows Defender, Sync Host, Update Orchestrator, Background Intelligent Transfer Service and so on. privacy.sexy was used for those leftover by tiny11builder and Win11Debloat. Disable misc features that doesn\u0026rsquo;t benefit WTG but wears out flash memory: hibernation, virtual memory, system restore, indexing, scheduled defrag and so on. Use simplewall instead of windows firewall. For better hardware/software compatibility, Windows 10 LTSC 2021/2019 is a better choice where you can have Shadow Defender or Rollback RX for easier system protection/recovery.

For my situation, investing time and money into my skills, knowledge, and projects yields more return and safer than in finance.\nBut in this time, I found some good VPN deals which I would like to pay with XMR. Plus it\u0026rsquo;s convenient to have some spare crypto in wallet for making donations to my favorite creators and projects, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to set things up.\nMuch like other people who\u0026rsquo;s into technology itself, I do my wallet quite differently comparing to common speculators and conspiracy theorists, some where in between and even go beyond.\nGoing as free and open-source as possible is my goal, and I\u0026rsquo;ve read Mastering Monero before which makes me more into this particular currency. So, I would not like to deal with BTC alike unless I\u0026rsquo;ve to pay for a bitcoin ransom. But which is not so likely to happen.\nCold Wallet (Tails, Feather and KeepAssXC) Although using the official monero gui/cli is the best way for creating cold wallets, I decide to go with Feather to try something new since I\u0026rsquo;ve been used the official tools years before for mining (perhaps winter heating).\nGet Tails first, then verify hash to check if it returns 46ff2ce0f3b9d3e64df95c4371601a70c78c1bc4e2977741419593ce14a810a7\nsha256sum tails-amd64-6.10.img Verify signature\nTZ=UTC gpg --no-options --keyid-format long --verify tails-amd64-6.10.img.sig tails-amd64-6.10.img Get Feather and verify hash to check if it returns 6bd5d04e9dbfe80525880bdb72217712bd67dda170c0f18570b876d28bdecd6a\nsha256sum feather-2.7.0-a.AppImage Verify signature to check if it returns \u0026ldquo;Good signature\u0026rdquo;:\ngpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --search dev@featherwallet.org gpg --verify feather-2.7.0-a.AppImage.asc feather-2.7.0-a.AppImage Create Tails USB drive with cli or Etcher and boot into it.

Now the biggest risk is losing credentials rather than being stolen, so I need to make sure backing things up in the end.\nIn the KeepAss entry, use the password generator to create a crazy password which is impossible to memorize nor type for feather wallet since it is the weakest link in my defense model.\nAfter finish the wallet creation, export view only wallet key and qrcode as needed.\nThis is the cold wallet without going too paranoid. I feel sorry for people who blindly decide to use pen and paper. Of course there are use cases for old school techniques, but non-tech people are probably having bigger trouble with their online hygiene practice and Surveillance Self-Defense skills.\nWhat even worse is those who print their paper wallet with a modern printer! For those people, please read through The Hitchhiker’s Guide. This is way more beneficial than maintaining paper or investing in a hardware wallet.\nBack to our topic, we have our cold wallet settled for now. Next step is to set up a hot wallet with haveno.\nHot Wallet (Kicksecure + Haveno + VeraCrypt) For the system I want to run on a day-to-day basis, portable distros such as Tails and Kodachi are not good options. I really like ParrotOS\u0026rsquo;s built-in anonsurf, but that OS is a bit heavy and more leaning towards offense.\nSo, there is not lot of option for purely defensive pre-hardened OS which is stationary—Qubes and Kicksecure are left in the sight.\nQubes is a heavy OS (6.4 GB iso) which built upon Fedora with Xen hypervisor baked-in and sometimes not even considered as a Linux distro (meaning some learning curve). On the other hand, Kicksecure is a hardened lightweight Debian (1.3 GB iso) that Whonix is based-on (meaning work out-of-the-box).\nSince I have enough low-end hardware to gain better compartmentalization, and system-wide torification is not ideal for a fiat/crypto mixed environment, so Kicksecure fits me the best.\nDownload Kicksecure and install it with Etcher.\nAfter the OS is ready, install Tor browser:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt full-upgrade sudo apt install --no-install-recommends tb-updater tb-starter update-torbrowser torbrowser Haveno is a Monero based fork of Bisq—open-source, non-KYC/custodial (even no registration) and private with Tor.\nDownload and run RetoSwap (Haveno-reto), it is a 3rd party Haveno instance recommended by this guide and in this video.\nAt the moment of writing this post, there are some issues with their unfinished new website so that I can\u0026rsquo;t get the public key from them. This is skeptical but also understandable, just take with a grain of salt.\nTo verify the files, I have to find the key file from here:\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- mDMEZmhlIhYJKwYBBAHaRw8BAQdAlZx+3Fdi66/YBIHyCbOovxh7luW9r4G13UxX FOSQZSu0BHJldG+ImQQTFgoAQRYhBNqiTYeLjTbJASCol8oC2sEtri0PBQJmaGUi AhsDBQkFo1V+BQsJCAcCAiICBhUKCQgLAgQWAgMBAh4HAheAAAoJEMoC2sEtri0P n3gA/0f8+oU+dO9xsCdRynkBCdM2QWfQ3LkyhRf11mhIxGAAAP9cA5/eetIwwhTO AaIC6q4KBATTAN1cEhkeIMKSLDURDrg4BGZoZSISCisGAQQBl1UBBQEBB0A4FBiE cTUkbx33xmIVPv+WwbWLZeL3PBIUUhzirqDqZQMBCAeIfgQYFgoAJhYhBNqiTYeL jTbJASCol8oC2sEtri0PBQJmaGUiAhsMBQkFo1V+AAoJEMoC2sEtri0PWk4A/3UU X4JoX3+FZonPJfWc+HzCnuTEcDZKJzlVrtPFeMNnAP9HYF32KiRtjTgKORyCzBeY lFen4bY4fUNtKz5RjWnVAg== =QJTO -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Save it as reto_public.asc or just download it from web cache, then check if it returns \u0026ldquo;Good signature\u0026rdquo;:\ngpg --import reto_public.asc gpg --verify v1.0.14-hashes.txt.sig v1.0.14-hashes.txt gpg --verify haveno-linux-appimage.zip.sig haveno-linux-appimage.zip sha512sum haveno-linux-appimage.zip The sha512 checksum of the zip file should be adbbed81f5e898f29fa9a1966c86c5c42bd23edbb57ebdb4d9e8895cd4d0d50c0468c126ecc4e0089df126b0d96d20b3dd5688f3f39b4418d4e18da367e8f089 and the packed desktop-1.0.14-SNAPSHOT-all.jar.SHA-256 seems irrelevant.\nNow run haveno-v1.0.14-linux-x86_64.AppImage and it will be automatically connecting to the Tor network first, Haveno network by next, then sync with Monero Mainnet at last. So this would take some time.\nNext step is to set up the accounts. In the Account page, add a new account for traditional currency, then set a password for Haveno hot wallet and do a backup. This Haveno_backup folder should be easy to locate for later backup.\nAdditionally, download Feather Wallet and restore the secret view key of the cold wallet for convenience.\nThis post is mainly focusing on operations security than transaction, so let\u0026rsquo;s wrap it up here with two more backups (3-2-1 principle).\nDownload Veracrypt generic installer with key and signature, check if the key\u0026rsquo;s fingerprint is 5069A233D55A0EEB174A5FC3821ACD02680D16DE\nwget https://launchpad.net/veracrypt/trunk/1.26.14/+download/veracrypt-1.26.14-setup.tar.bz2 wget https://launchpad.net/veracrypt/trunk/1.26.14/+download/veracrypt-1.26.14-setup.tar.bz2.sig wget https://www.idrix.fr/VeraCrypt/VeraCrypt_PGP_public_key.asc gpg --import --import-options show-only VeraCrypt_PGP_public_key.asc Then import the key, verify the signature to check if it returns Good signature\ngpg --import VeraCrypt_PGP_public_key.asc gpg --verify veracrypt-1.26.14-setup.tar.bz2.sig veracrypt-1.26.14-setup.tar.bz2 Extract, install and run\ntar -xf veracrypt-1.26.14-setup.tar.bz2 sudo ./veracrypt-1.26.14-setup-gtk2-gui-x64 veracrypt Here I use a small microSD card since this media type gives more environmental resilience compare to regular flash drive.\nPlug in the SD card adapter, follow instructions of VeraCrypt Volumes - Create new Volume - Encrypt a non-system partition/drive - Hidden VeraCrypt volume to create a Hidden Volume around 100MB.\nThis anti-forensic feature goes beyond my threat model but it is fun to have.\nThe microSD card is ready for later use. Now, grab another USB drive which is better to be rugged, use same procedure to create Tails live system again.\nBoot and set it up in the \u0026ldquo;air-gapped\u0026rdquo; machine, and plug the main cold wallet drive.\nMount the Encrypted persistent storage with password, and copy everything needed from TailsData/Persistent into Home/Persistent.\nThe backup cold wallet drive is done. Now eject the main cold wallet drive. Decrypt and mount the Kicksecure HDD where the hot wallet is at.\nPlug in the SD card adapter and decrypt it with the outer volume passphrase. Copy the hot wallet Haveno_backup folder into the outer volume then eject.\nRe-insert and decrypt it again but this time with hidden volume passphrase. Copy the feather_data folder and KeepAss database file of the cold wallet in there, then eject.\nBy now, three copies of the cold wallet are created. This is more than enough since my threat model is more against theft and natural disasters rather than getting hacked by cybercriminals or infiltrated by state actors.\nBeing a low value hard target is my way of security.\nAlso, protecting crypto wallet at home is all about OPSEC. No shenanigans such as farady bags or handwriting papers whatsoever!\nSo properly labeling them and putting one into a watertight container inside a fire resistant safe is good enough. I\u0026rsquo;ll send another one to a remote location as well.\nFeel free to email me if you have any question or would like to social engineer me in a good way : )\nStay safe and sharp!\nReferences:\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to Online Anonymity: https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html\nHaveno DEX Direct Fiat to Monero transactions: https://blog.nowhere.moe/opsec/haveno-client-f2f/index.html\nHaveno Documentation: https://docs.haveno.exchange/the-project/\nFeather Wallet Documentation: https://docs.featherwallet.org/\nMalvarma cold wallet guide for Monero: https://malvarma.org/intro.html\nMastering Monero: https://masteringmonero.com/free-download.html\nAttack of the Poisoned Outputs: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk4xsazIq6TZUKDScrxFjhajOKTlHknRx\nMonero Talk EPI 166: https://youtu.be/16c03c4kG8k\nkycnot: https://kycnot.me/\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/menero-wallet/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEventually, I found myself with enough leisure and motivation to set up a crypto wallet.

Although I\u0026rsquo;m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.\nBeing a free account user, I\u0026rsquo;ve never done torrenting or any other heavy usage on their servers. It is not moral even though the provider allows me to.\nProbably because of my account was old enough so that my country selection feature wasn\u0026rsquo;t banned until latest update.\nThere are some concerns that preventing me from paying their services to regain that feature. It\u0026rsquo;s not about their product, but more about their business strategy.\nAlthough there are always some criticism and antagonism among the community.\nProtonmail is Propaganda ProtonMail doesn’t encrypt all emails “by design” ProtonMail Now Keeps IP Logs NEVER Use ProtonMail Without This NEW FEATURE! PRIVATE Email But my stand is more towards where All Things Secured and Techlore are. That is, as long as Proton is better than Google, issue with registration, warrant canary or false advertising are tolerable. However, now I\u0026rsquo;ll be putting a question mark on that though.\nProtonmail was like another Tutanota, and Proton VPN was like another IVPN/PIA. But, is it? still\u0026hellip;by now?\nAs the company grows, their policy is getting loser and loser, and their suit is getting larger and larger. They starts to put more attention tweaking their terms of service rather than refining their product. They prefer expansion rather than perfection, and care more about market share rather than user experience.\nDoes this market strategy sound familiar? Yes, my concern is that Proton now looks too much like baby Google back in the days. Free users are going to be their products, and that is when enshittification starts.\nI strongly agree with Cory Doctorow and I believe that Proton is indeed going on the same track right now. Privacy is nothing more than another brand positioning strategy because that was a good niche market to start their business.\nIn the economy of Chokepoint Capitalism, Proton is not different than Google in its core. If one day Proton gets to the top of market dominance, becoming yet another big tech company, what would end up happening?\nMy answer to this concern is to against market expansion by advocating open-source community back to free/GNU realm. In the privacy and security world, open-source isn\u0026rsquo;t enough and could be abused.\nOrganization should stay focus in-depth and refine their product or service for optimization, not the other way around. They should not conquer new markets, and expand feature or create new product quicker than demands.\nAnother bad example is what Proton and SimpleLogin did. Bundle everything together to become a one-stop solution is against the principle of decentralization which is a no-no for privacy.\nBack to reality, how do I personally deal with the enshittification of Proton VPN which gets in my way unexpectedly?\nThere is a simple workaround for Proton VPN\u0026rsquo;s region lock and it\u0026rsquo;s officially supported.\nPer their current statement, free plan gets \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; countries/servers in recent updates, but users just can\u0026rsquo;t manual select them due to the newly updated restriction in their app.\nSo the solution is to ditch their official client and use a 3rd party open-source alternative.\nThis is pretty much the same way as using Proton VPN on a router.\nThere are official OpenVPN guides on the account\u0026rsquo;s downloads page for every single platform on how to manually install and connect your configuration files based on the server of your choice.\nCheck them out: Android iOS Windows macOS and GNU/Linux\nBut what I did is WireGuard. They have the guides as well for Windows macOS Linux Android and iOS. There are many other unofficial guides on different router firmwares but I don\u0026rsquo;t need to go that far.\nWhat I liked about WireGuard over OpenVPN is that despite all the security advantages, it is convenient for mobile devices. The WireGuard client supports QR code scan from the Proton website\u0026rsquo;s Create button. This made the process much easier when I trying to add multiple servers.\nWireGuard mobile app works more reliable and efficient on my device than ProtonVPN app. The only potential drawback is I have to maintain my list of servers manually over time.\nHope this can help someone in the same situation.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/proton-shit/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs a early adopter of Protonmail, I use their later coming VPN product as well, regularly yet lightly.

You can use a browser extension like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey to run the script on the website. Here\u0026#39;s the user script: javascript // ==UserScript== // @name Fix Missing Scrollbar // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Fixes missing scrollbar on chatgpt.com by changing overflow-hidden to overflow-visible // @author Your Name // @match https://chatgpt.com/* // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { \u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; // Function to update the class overflow-hidden to overflow-visible function fixScrollbar() { const elements = document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;.flex-1.overflow-hidden\u0026#39;); elements.forEach((el) =\u0026gt; { el.classList.remove(\u0026#39;overflow-hidden\u0026#39;); el.classList.add(\u0026#39;overflow-visible\u0026#39;); }); } // Run the function after the DOM content is fully loaded window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, function() { fixScrollbar(); }); // Optional: Observe for future changes in case dynamic content is loaded const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) =\u0026gt; { mutations.forEach(() =\u0026gt; { fixScrollbar(); }); }); // Start observing the body for DOM changes observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true }); })(); ### How this works: - The script runs on every page of `chatgpt.com` (`@match https://chatgpt.com/*`). - It selects elements with the class `flex-1 overflow-hidden`, and changes the `overflow-hidden` class to `overflow-visible`. - The script uses a `MutationObserver` to watch for changes to the DOM, so the scrollbar fix remains even if new content is dynamically loaded. ### Instructions: 1. Install a user script manager like **Tampermonkey** or **Greasemonkey** in your browser. 2. Create a new script and paste the code above. 3. Save the script and reload the webpage. This should fix the missing scrollbar issue on the website. It took me a few attempts to get the right direction, but far eaiser than learning how to write javascript.\nWhen I was doing my repair shop many years ago, I used to make joke that you can\u0026rsquo;t fix it if your only soldering iron is broken.\nBut it seems that I can fix my broken ChatGPT with itself : )\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/chat-scroll/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, I encountered a scrolling problem on ChatGPT web like \u003ca href=\"https://community.openai.com/t/after-submitting-query-to-chatgpt-cant-scroll-at-all/696051/58?page=4\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e.

We need to control our own destiny and not get locked into a closed vendor. We need to protect our data. We need a model that is efficient and affordable to run. We want to invest in the ecosystem that’s going to be the standard for the long term. That describes the needs of tech individuals and small businesses accurately.\nThe reason I call it \u0026ldquo;Menifesto\u0026rdquo; because the impression of reading this article connects back to the GNU Manifesto strongly.\nThanks to the GNU project that made us free/libre OSes; Thanks to the LLaMA development team made us true open AIs.\nEgoism-Altruism Dialectic In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith wrote:\nHow selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.\nThis selfish altruism or ethical egoism idea has been carried on by many Austrian school and behavioral economists, and eventually became a key principle of neoliberalism ideology.\nHowever, it is more complex for the case of Zuckerberg and his Meta.\nIn his statement, Zuckerberg is clearly aware of what is the benefits of embracing open-source—profitable yet moral.\nAs we all know, in silicon valley, nobody really cares about \u0026ldquo;the greater good\u0026rdquo; nor really wants to \u0026ldquo;making the world a better place\u0026rdquo;. They are just responsible to their stakeholders.\nBut what about a win-win situation?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly what they are selling to the public to believe (feel).\nThe dialectical structure remains the same as the egoism-altruism dialectic—A self-interest business man pursuing profit but pretending being moral.\nThe important thing is: Will this resulting a win-win situation for public good?\nThe answer is that it depends, and most likely no. These too-big-to-fail companies are reactionary in its core.\nAchieving the greater good is hard and it is naive to believe that it is the byproduct of the [big] Other\u0026rsquo;s selfishness. Unless we, the 99%, involve into this dialectic movement as a proactive agent. Otherwise, our society will be destroyed by climate crisis before having the chance of running into the \u0026ldquo;Post-Human Dystopia\u0026rdquo;.\nNo Degrowth No Acceleration As I mentioned before in my speech, the dangers of technology, big techs will never shrink their data centers for sustainability without changing the underlying political-economic order, unless next economic cycle/depression comes again.\nOur estimate of OpenAI’s $4 billion in inference costs comes from a person with knowledge of the cluster of servers OpenAI rents from Microsoft. That cluster has the equivalent of 350,000 Nvidia A100 chips, this person said. About 290,000 of those chips, or more than 80% of the cluster, were powering ChartGPT, this person said.\n— Amir Efrati and Aaron Holmes\nMarking a major investment in Meta’s AI future, we are announcing two 24k GPU clusters. We use this cluster design for Llama 3 training. This announcement is one step in our ambitious infrastructure roadmap. By the end of 2024, we’re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.\n— Building Meta’s GenAI Infrastructure\nZuckerberg will keep expanding their AI clusters to match up with OpenAI/MS, Google and so on. Open-Source is nothing more than a competitive strategy to Meta after all.\nNoam Chomsky and Kohei Saito\u0026rsquo;s advocates for degrowth is very appealing but we should never solely counting on that. Just like a Virtual Machine cannot surpass the limitation of its underlying physical machine. Green politics cannot even sustain itself when it is running above neoliberal economy.\nNow, the condition is clear, but What Is to Be Done? Clearly, neither Degrowth nor Accelerationism are helpful in Anthropocene era. But what about Slavoj Žižek\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Moderate Conservatism\u0026rdquo;?\nSaaSS or Cloud Fiefs? On the internet, proprietary software isn’t the only way to lose your freedom. Service as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS, is another way to let someone else have power over your computing. SaaSS means using a service implemented by someone else as a substitute for running your copy of a program. The term is ours; articles and ads won’t use it, and they won’t tell you whether a service is SaaSS. Instead they will probably use the vague and distracting term “cloud,” which lumps SaaSS together with various other practices, some abusive and some OK.\nOne of the many meanings of “cloud computing” is storing your data in online services. In most scenarios, that is foolish because it exposes you to surveillance. Another meaning (which overlaps that but is not the same thing) is Service as a Software Substitute, which denies you control over your computing. You should never use SaaSS.\n— Richard Stallman, Who Does That Server Really Serve?\nRMS wrote this essay long ago, but recently Yanis Varoufakis took this loss of freedom notion a step further in today\u0026rsquo;s context.\nIt took mind-bending scientific breakthroughs, fantastical-sounding neural networks and imagination-defying AI programs to accomplish what? To turn workers toiling in warehouses, driving cabs and delivering food into cloud proles. To create a world where markets are increasingly replaced by cloud fiefs. To force businesses into the role of vassals. And to turn all of us into cloud serfs, glued to our smartphones and tablets, eagerly producing the cloud capital that keeps our new overlords on cloud nine.\n— Yanis Varoufakis, Technofeudalism - What Killed Capitalism\nIn the Age of Cloud Capital, our freedom is taken away by cloudalists who own the Online service/SaaSS/Cloud fief to charge us for a subscription fee, or so called \u0026ldquo;cloud rent\u0026rdquo;. Of course they want to control over our device (computing), our attention (wallet) and our life (labor).\nSo, how do we reclaim our freedom and democracy?\nI claim that we shall free [as libre] and democratize [as decentralize] our digital life first, by adopting open-source alternatives, and self-hosting if at all possible. This is my version of \u0026ldquo;cloud rebellion\u0026rdquo; to overthrow technofeudalism, and it is the same stone which Jacob Appelbaum shooting at Surveillance [Capitalism].\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the hardest thing to work against how a system functions. The outcome would be the recoil of more severe economic crisis, the iteration of Green Capitalism and the backfire of Alt-Right.\nTo overcome this system deadlock, we need to workaround the feedback loops, identify and alter the leverage points as Donella Meadows indicates.\nSo what and where is the leverage points in the capitalism system exactly? I think it\u0026rsquo;s every Creative Destruction which Joseph Schumpeter suggested. For example, the AI boom we are currently experiencing, and Llama and Stable Diffusion are the strongest creative-destructive forces out there.\nWe also need David Graeber\u0026rsquo;s Direct Action but within our digital life.\nTreating Schizophrenia and Depression There are a lot of resources like gofoss and Privacy Guides which are easy to start with. But we will focus on local LLMs right now. Tools like ollama, Jan, GPT4All and llamafile works great for self-hosting LLMs either on localhost or local area network.\nThis is the first step of regaining our freedom from the oligarches by leveraging the creative-destructive force of open-source AI. The goal is to encourage tech-savvy people do more self-hosting and non-tech-savvy people use more decentralized services/instances which maintained by the open-source community, like Fediverse.\nYes, Zuckerberg indeed integrated Fediverse and open-sourced LLaMA, and it is not because his virtue. So does Alibaba and its Qwen. This is because, in Gilles Deleuze\u0026rsquo;s terms, Capitalism is schizophrenic which means it is self-deterritorialized by its nature. To put it simple, that is another way of Karl Marx\u0026rsquo;s famous claim—capitalism is self-destructive.\nIf we really want to save our environment by degrowth, it has to be bottom-up not the opposite. More self-hosting, decentralized LLMs leads to less market demand for massive AI clusters [at least for inference], so that the supply of data center will start to drop spontaneously.\nRegulations have its meaning but will never solve the problem effectively in a competitive market, and the human needs and desire cannot be simply pushed away. The excessive legislative intervention can result unemployment which leads to the resurgence of Conservative but in its worse condition, Ultraconservatism.\nThis is want Sigmund Freud called \u0026ldquo;the insistent return of the repressed\u0026rdquo;. The cure is to be more self-sufficient—to fulfill our needs by our own hands rather than being fed up with Surplus-Enjoyment of Consumerism by the [big] Other.\nHistory has proven that Capitalism could not be ended by Communism which we have already seen, but it is definitely not Fukuyama\u0026rsquo;s the End of History.\nEvery dead end (cycle) of Capitalism can be altered by Entrepreneurship. Not in the sense of \u0026ldquo;everyone is an entrepreneur\u0026rdquo;, but everyone has an [not so] equal opportunity to take action [in their own way]—to participate, to get involved, and to be skin in the game of a technological revolution and its following social transformation.\nIn Lacanian psychoanalysis, when treating psychosis, the analyst should ally with the patient by taking the role of the secretary (entrepreneur) and play by the rule of the patient (free market). Then, find a fixation (opportunity) and encourage the patient to reposition their psychic structure (circular flow) into something more stable and sustainable. In the case of Capitalism, the fixation [or anchoring point] is Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS).\nDecentralized self-hosting of local LLMs is like Deleuze\u0026rsquo;s Rhizome. It can decrease the demand of proprietary market and eventually dismantle the AI monoliths. This free-flowing, productive transformation of FOSS is the way to cure Capitalism\u0026rsquo;s disease and to save our environment.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know what it will be after the Capitalism, as Mark Fisher suggested, it is impossible even to imagine of that. But we still need to go beyond the never-ending endgame of Late Capitalism, jailbreak the depressive Capitalist Realism, and recreate a future where anything is possible (everyone has freedom).\nHere is a list of books that constructed the context of this post:\nLudwig von Mises - Human Action: A Treatise on Economics Joseph Schumpeter - Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy Murray Rothbard - Man, Economy, and State Adam Smith - The Theory of Moral Sentiments Kohei Saito - Marx in the Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism Noam Chomsky - Optimism over Despair Donella Meadows - Thinking In Systems David Graeber - Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology Yanis Varoufakis - Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism Richard Stallman - Free Software, Free Society Jean Baudrillard - The Consumer Society Gilles Deleuze - Capitalism and Schizophrenia Francis Fukuyama - The End of History and the Last Man Slavoj Žižek - Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism Slavoj Žižek - The Sublime Object of Ideology Bruce Fink - Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique A Lacanian Approach for Practitioners Dany Nobus - Key Concepts of Lacanian Psychoanalysis Zygmunt Bauman - Work, Consumerism and the New Poor David Harvey - A Brief History of Neoliberalism Murray Bookchin - The Ecology of Freedom Mark Fisher - Capitalist Realism ","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/ethics-llm/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-open-source-ai-manifesto\"\u003ethe \u0026ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Zuckerberg has been \u003ca href=\"https://stallman.org/facebook.html\"\u003ehated by Richard Stallman\u003c/a\u003e for decades and he is the only person who appears on both cover image of the video essays: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/oLLxpAZzy0s\"\u003eHow the Internet was Stolen\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/BQTXv5jm6s4\"\u003eHow AI was Stolen\u003c/a\u003e by Then \u0026amp; Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, things has changed recently after his adoption of the Fediverse and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/lJ_NRIKbRKc\"\u003eopen-sourcing of Llama\u003c/a\u003e continuously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/\"\u003eZuckerberg\u0026rsquo;s latest \u0026ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e, he stated 5 needs of open-source:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe need to train, fine-tune, and distill our own models.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe need to control our own destiny and not get locked into a closed vendor.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe need to protect our data.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe need a model that is efficient and affordable to run.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe want to invest in the ecosystem that’s going to be the standard for the long term.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat describes the needs of tech individuals and small businesses accurately.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Ethics of Local LLMs: A Response to Zuckerberg's ''Open Source AI Manifesto''"},{"content":"AI-Generated content can be fun or \u0026ldquo;slop\u0026rdquo; according to Simon Willison, but also can be malevolent due to its abuse in phishing attacks.\nSome of my readers may have already known that recently I\u0026rsquo;m working on a side project , which based onchatgpt-html and uses LLMs to detect phishing emails.

A free GNU/Linux distro is needed to be reinstalled.\nWhen done backing up the old OS, download preferred distro and boot it from an USB drive.\nPrepare another USB drive for /boot partition, since UEFI doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with the internal eMMc storage. This boot drive is necessary for every power-on or reboot. Choose a low-profile one so that is appropriate to be semi-permanent.\nWhile installation (custom), make the /boot and /boot/efi mounting points on the boot drive (sda), and everything else, like /, /home and swap on the internal storage (mmcblk0).\nThis UEFI boot workaround should also work with Windows system. Not only due to the reason I stated before, but also I really like the freeness of this laptop.\nIt is suggested to use a small-size (mine is 4GB), slow-speed but reliable USB drive for boot drive. Use some tools like RMPrepUSB or MBROSTool to test a USB drive and make backup boot drives with Clonezilla.\nIn the end, use rsync, Clonezilla or both to restore the old system folders like /home. There are extra files such as /etc/keyd/default.conf and a few software from /usr/share/ and /opt/*. After the new system booted, reinstall keyd and other softwares as needed. The only broken thing was my custom theme for mate. Changing to another theme is a quick fix.\nAfter this firmware upgrade, the sound card problem is fixed and the driver is now fully funtional out of the box.\nBelow is the original content dated at 2022-11-09.\nRecently, I got a new ThinkPad which took Lenovo over 2 month preparing for shipping. For the price, it worth waiting. This is the first Chromebook I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had, so I did quite a lot experiments with it.\nHardware The model is C13 Yoga Chromebook (MORPHIUS) with AMD Athlon gold 3015c (Picasso) 4GB RAM and 32GB eMMc storage.\nThere are multiple variations in C13 models and mine is the lowest-end of them. It is the cheapest ThinkPad I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, even cheaper than my old one (Sandy Bridge, bought used on 2016).\nThe stylus pen is thinner and the touchscreen isn\u0026rsquo;t compatible with my old stylus pen although they feel very similar on hand.\nForce Power-off There are a few techniques from the official documents. I tried and none of them works for a serious freeze like kernel panic. Therefore, I physically disabled the built-in battery for convenience. Fortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to do without leaving a scratch or tearing up any label.\nHard and doesn\u0026rsquo;t work: press Refresh ⟳ together with the Power button for about five seconds, and at the same time detach the ac power adapter from the Chromebook Works only for normal freeze: disconnect all power sources. Press and hold the power button for about seven seconds Firmware Disable CR50 hardware write protection and modify bootloader I followed instructions from coolstar, pl-luk, and Mrchromebox to replace Tianocore with coreboot + SeaBIOS.\nEnter Recovery Mode with ESC + ⟳ + Power: press/hold ESC and Refresh, then press Power for ~1s CTRL+D to switch to Developer Mode and confirm CTRL+D again to wipe userdata for Developer Mode Connect WiFi and select Browse as a Guest Use CTRL+ALT+T in Chrome to Open the CCD Run shell in the Crosh shell to switch shell Run sudo crossystem dev_boot_altfw=1 and sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb=1 and sudo crossystem dev_boot_signed_only=0; sync to enable extra boot entries Run sudo flashrom --wp-disable and sudo flashrom --wp-range=0,0 to disable write protection Run MrChromebox\u0026rsquo;s script: cd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo bash firmware-util.sh Reboot and either select Select alternate bootloader → Tianocore/coreboot (CTRL+L)\u0026quot; or Boot from external Disk (CTRL+U) as needed Linux on ThinkPad C13 Yoga Tails Thanks to folks from r/chrultrabook. I found adding iommu=pt to the Grab2 menu options fixed the booting problem for many Live CD distros. Here are more parameters maybe useful:\nvideo=eDP-1:1920x1080-32@60 iommu=pt mem_encrypt=off amdgpu.ras_enable=0 amdgpu.audio=0 Depthboot I\u0026rsquo;ve tried the prebuild EupneaOS image and didn\u0026rsquo;t like its flavor. Therefore, I followed Depthboot instructions to build from scratch.\nOn a Linux machine, insert a USB drive and run git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/eupnea-linux/depthboot-builder; cd depthboot-builder; ./main.py inside a terminal Choose a flavor, select the USB drive to flash directly, for me its sdb, and it takes a few mins to finish Put the depthboot USB drive into the Chromebook and hit Ctrl+U (Boot from external disk) at the bootloader Boot into the newly created Linux and test everything out. In my case, only the sound card and suspend has issue Connect to internet, then open a terminal, update and run setup-audio to fix the sound card driver (acp3xalc5682m98357) run install-to-internal to start installation. It will use /dev/mmcblk1 which means wiping the entire 32GB eMMc/HDD without preserving Chrome OS partition When installation finishes, reboot and use Ctrl+D (Boot from internal disk) to boot into the new system Depthboot created Linux distros runs pretty well on my C13. Suspend doesn\u0026rsquo;t suppose to work on this hardware and I don\u0026rsquo;t really need it. The sound card is far more problematic because acp3xalc5682m98357 (Maxim 98357a) is a tough one to work with.\nThanks to eupnea-audio-script. With kernel version 5.10.131, I was able to get the built-in speakers working but not for the headphone port. Here\u0026rsquo;s more test results:\nSemi-functional sound card under Fedora 37, Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10—speakers are fixed but not for the headphone port Not working sound card under Ubuntu LTS 22.04 and Arch—the script didn\u0026rsquo;t fix anything Workarounds are plenty, for example, using Bluetooth headphones or buying a cheap small USB sound card like C-Media ones that can plug n play.\nMATE Desktop Environment Breath used to provide MATE as one of the desktop options. Depthboot added Pop!_OS which is very nice but removed my favorite DE from all distros.\nMATE consumes much less resources while provides a decent UX/UI. Because of that, it\u0026rsquo;s superior than any other desktop options for my C13. Most important, GNOME 2 was my first daily driver linux desktop.\nUse Depthboot main.py script to create a cli(no desktop) version of fedora, ubuntu cli had minor booting issue Boot into the Dephboot drive on C13 and use nmtui → Active a connection to connect WiFi Run install-to-internal and sudo reboot. Boot into internal disk and log into fedora cli To install MATE, run sudo dnf -y group install \u0026quot;MATE-Desktop\u0026quot; or for less package sudo dnf -y install @mate-desktop. In case of installing as secondary DE, add --allowerasing to resolve conflicts Run echo \u0026quot;exec /usr/bin/mate-session\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.xinitrcand startx to launch MATE Fix twice login problem It happens to LightDM, so both MATE and Xfce can be affected.

It brings back all missing keys such as F11/F12, volume controls and the ability to Ctrl+Alt+Del. Now we can have a fully functional keyboard on a Chromebook.\nOptimize Liunx For my C13, I think the cost of timeshift is more than what I can get from it. I\u0026rsquo;d rather use traditional backup methods like clonezilla or simply tar occasionally. Always make backups before doing anything funny.\nGo to System Settings - Hardware - Keyboard Shortcuts or run dconf-editor to setup hotkeys.

It\u0026rsquo;s recommend to setup Windows without internet Windows Post-Installation Coolstar guide also provides a full set of drivers for ThinkPad C13. Sound card may works with both speaker and headphone depending on which Windows is installed.\nAfter tested a couple of versions of Windows10/11, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get the touchscreen, touchpad and trackpoint working on any of them. This ruins my intention of using Windows on C13. Although at this point, it is able to play games with USB gaming gears.\nI still want to share some opinion on Windows since it\u0026rsquo;s not limited on a single hardware.\nTo test out different Windows versions running on a new device, Microsoft-Activation-Scripts can make things easier.\nFor me, LTSC 2021 (21H2) is the sweet spot between up-to-date and RAM efficiency among all current versions.\nHere is the final result:\nen-us_windows_10_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_d289cf96.iso Defualt RAM\tAvaliable 2771MB 30% C:\\ 17GB Used After OOSU10/Windows10Debloater \u0026amp; privacy.sexy RAM\tAvaliable 3088MB 24% C:\\ 9.5GB Used tiny10 21H2 x64 2209.iso Defualt RAM\tAvaliable 3088MB 24% C:\\ 8GB Used After OOSU10/Windows10Debloater \u0026amp; privacy.sexy \u0026amp; Debloat-Windows-10 RAM\tAvaliable 3196MB 21% C:\\ 8.2GB Used Although the mod version, tiny10 is generally not being trusted. It shows how much more we can get by modifying the image than post-install scripts.\nAlso, when considering privacy, people tend to think using Windows 10 is a joke. It\u0026rsquo;s half true.\nUsing OOSU10/Windows10Debloater can make things less worse. Additionally, using privacy.sexy can make it better. If we need to go further, Debloat-Windows-10 has a whole set of useful scripts to run or customize, for example, my favorite disable-services.ps1.\nEven not for privacy enhancement, just for better resource efficiency. These post-install scripts are worth to have—by reducing background CPU/Network/Disk activity, RAM/Storage consumption.\nYes, if use the aggressive rule set, it will break things up—until you notice it. Even if it really bothers you, most of the time it is reversible.\nFor more security enhancement, BitLocker/VeraCrypt and Windows-Optimize-Harden-Debloat are recommended.\nhenrypp\u0026rsquo;s simplewall + hostsmgr is a good alternative to Windows Firewall + SmartScreen which doesn\u0026rsquo;t cut off all those crazy traffic with Microsoft and its affiliate servers.\nhostsmgr generates a huge host file for blocking those unnecessary traffic as much as possible but it conflicts with DNS client service (dnscache). StevenBlack\u0026rsquo;s script solves the problem or by simply switching to NextDNS which is a modern alternative to the old hosts file methods.\nFor machines with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage in the modern days, we may need some cleanup methods from the old days but not with those outdated tools.\nAlso made by henrypp, memreduct can save a lot of memory that eating up by poorly made software. Use it wisely will definitely optimize the system performance. For storage, with bleachbit and WinDirStat would be enough to keep C13 running for years.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/tpc13/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"2024-update\"\u003e2024 Update\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mrchromebox.tech/#home\"\u003eMrChromebox.tech\u003c/a\u003e had a major update a few month ago, so I decide to move on as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before that, use \u003ca href=\"https://clonezilla.org/\"\u003eClonezilla\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ccode\u003ersync -aHAXS\u003c/code\u003e to back up the 32 GB emmc first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun in terminal, install \u0026ldquo;Full UEFI Firmware\u0026rdquo;\n\u003ccode\u003ecd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo bash firmware-util.sh\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reboot, a full version of  \u003ca href=\"http://www.coreboot.org/\"\u003ecoreboot\u003c/a\u003e is installed, by replacing the previous \u003ca href=\"http://www.seabios.org/\"\u003eSeaBIOS\u003c/a\u003e which is partial and limited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes this laptop now with a free firmware.

So I decided to let it sit in a drawer for 180 days and then see what I can do with it.\nA few days ago, I unlocked it by simply go to About Phone then click Unlock.\nI am awaring of the Root Guide and not interested in playing with root on any stock ROM.

So, I decide to train a usable model with my own voice.\nThis voice cloning project explores both SVC for Voice Changing and VITS for Text-to-Speech. There is no one tool does all jobs.\nI have tested several tools for this project. Many of the good guides, like this, this and this, are in Chinese. So, I thought it\u0026rsquo;s useful to post my notes in English.\nAlthough so-vits-svc has been archived for a few months, probably due to oppression, it is still the tool for the best result.\nOther related tools such as so-vits-svc-fork, so-vits-svc-5.0, DDSP-SVC, and RVC provide either faster/liter optimization, more features or better interfaces.\nBut with enough time and resources, none of these alternatives can compete with the superior result generated by the original so-vits-svc.\nFor TTS, a new tool called Bert-VITS2 works fantastically and has already matured with its final release last month. It has some very different use case, for example, audio content creation.\nPrepare Dataset The audio files of the dataset should be WAV format, 44100 Hz, 16bit, mono, 1-2 hours ideally.\nExtract from a Song Ultimate Vocal Remover is the easiest tool for this job. There is a thread explains everything in details.\nUVR Workflows Remove and extract Instrumental Model: VR - UVR(4_HP-Vocal-UVR) Settings: 512 - 10 - GPU Output Instrumental and unclean vocal Remove and extract background vocal Model: VR - UVR(5_HP-Karaoke-UVR) Settings: 512 - 10 - GPU Output background vocal and unclean main vocal Remove reverb and noise Model: VR - UVR-DeEcho-DeReverb \u0026amp; UVR-DeNoise Settings: 512 - 10 - GPU - No Other Only Output clean main vocal (Optional) Using RipX (non-free) to perform a manual fine cleaning Preparation for vocal recording It\u0026rsquo;s better to record in a treated room with condenser microphone, otherwise use a directional or dynamic microphone to reduce noise.\nCheapskate\u0026rsquo;s Audio Equipment The very first time I\u0026rsquo;ve got into music was during my high school, with the blue Sennheiser MX500 and Koss Porta Pro. I still remember the first time I was recording a song that was on a Sony VAIO with Cool Edit Pro.\nNowadays, I still resist to spend a lot of money on audio hardware as an amateur because it is literally a money-sucking blackhole.\nNonetheless, I really appreciate the reliability of those cheap production equipment.\nThe core part of my setup is a Behringer UCA202 and it\u0026rsquo;s perfect for my use cases. I bought it for $10 while a price drop.\nIt is so called \u0026ldquo;Audio Interface\u0026rdquo; but basically just a sound card with multiple ports. I used RCA to 3.5mm TRS cables for my headphones, a semi-open K240s for regular output and a closed-back HD669/MDR7506 for monitor output.\nAll three mentioned headphones are under $100 for normal price. And there are clones from Samson, Tascam, Knox Gear and more out there for less than $50.\nFor the input device, I\u0026rsquo;m using a dynamic microphone for the sake of my environmental noises. It is a SM58 copy (Pyle) + a Tascam DR-05 recorder (as amplifier). Other clones such as SL84c or wm58 would do it too.\nI use a XLR to 3.5mm TRS cable to connect the microphone to the MIC/External-input of the recorder, and then use an AUX cable to connect between the line-out of the recorder and the input of the UCA202.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not recommend to buy an \u0026ldquo;audio interface\u0026rdquo; and a dedicated amplifier to replicate my setup. A $10 c-media USB sound card should be good enough. The Syba model that I owned is capable to \u0026ldquo;pre-amp\u0026rdquo; dynamic microphones directly and even some lower-end phantom powered microphones.\nThe setup can go extremely cheap ($40~60) but with UCA202 and DR-05, the sound is much cleaner. And I really like the physical controls, versatility and portability of my old good digital recorder.\nAudacity workflows Although when I was getting paid as a designer, I was pretty happy with Audition. But for personal use on a fun project, Audacity is the way to avoid the chaotic evil of Adobe.\nNoise Reduction Dereverb Truncate Silence Normalize audio-slicer Use audio-slicer or audio-slicer (gui) to slice the audio file into small pieces for later use.\nDefault setting works great.\nCleaning dataset Remove those very short ones and re-slice which are still over 10 seconds.\nIn case of large dataset, remove all that are less than 4 sec. In case of small dataset, remove only under 2 sec.\nIf necessary, perform manual inspection for every single file.\nMatch loudness Use Audacity again with Loudness Normalization, 0db should do it.\nso-vits-svc Set up environment Virtual environment is essential to run multiple python tools inside one system.

Just for production of a better song.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go into details in this since the audio editing software, or so called DAW (digital audio workstation), that I\u0026rsquo;m using are non-free. I have no intention to advocate proprietary software even though the entire industry is paywalled and closed-source.\nAudacity supports multitrack, effects and a lot more. It does load some advanced VST plugins as well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find tutorials on mastering songs with Audacity.\nTypically, the mastering process should be mixing/balancing, EQ/compressing, reverb, imaging. The more advanced the tool is, the easier the process will be.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll definitely spend more time on adopting Audacity for my mastering process in the future and I recommend everyone do so.\nso-vits-svc-fork This is a so-vits-svc fork with realtime support and the models are compatible.

My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.\nBack in the days, I used to repair people\u0026rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it. Then, I bought a cheap E3-1245 and GTX 750 Ti to make it a gaming rig. I played a lot of games on that, such as Dark Souls series and Metro series. Before it was sold, last games I played on this build was Metro Exodus and Elden Ring.\nSandy Bridge was the last generation using soldered integrated heat spreader (IHS) in a long time. It\u0026rsquo;s cooler and stays cool over time way better than its thermal-pasted successors (e.g. Haswell/Hotwell). Back then, there was a doggerel joking about AMD\u0026rsquo;s performance and Intel\u0026rsquo;s temperature, saying \u0026ldquo;Unlocking AMD, Delidding Intel.\u0026rdquo;\nThe real fun project was a LGA771 to LGA775 Mod on a Dell Vostro 220s. It was a hardware hack that letting this low-end Vostro uses a dirt cheap yet powerful Xeon. The motherboard also has 4 SATA ports so it works well as a NAS.\nNext is our today\u0026rsquo;s topic, Dell Optiplex 3010 SFF. It was on sell for quite a few months but seemingly no one wants it at all. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a completely garbage comparing the Vostro above. It came with an i3-3220 but has been upgraded to the i5-2300 that was replaced from the gaming rig for the sake of LGA 1155. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to put an Xeon E3 on it but a weird graphic card without output port.\nPhilosophy If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering—why bother spending such amount of time and effort tinkering those e-wastes? Just because of being a cheapskate and saving money?\nHere is the answer from my previous post:\nI really like the idea from cheapskatesguide and lowtechmagazine that could save people from the pitfalls of consumerism. Moreover, to me it\u0026rsquo;s not about saving money on technology nor adapting certain lifestyles. This is a manifestation of ideology, the way of pursuing freedom.\nBy this chance, I would like to add more details on that.\nOn the internet, proprietary software isn’t the only way to lose your freedom. Service as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS, is another way to let someone else have power over your computing.\nIf you use SaaSS, the server operator controls your computing. It requires entrusting all the pertinent data to the server operator, which will be forced to show it to the state as well—who does that server really serve, after all?\nSaaSS does not require covert code to obtain the user’s data. Instead, users must send their data to the server in order to use it. This has the same effect as spyware: the server operator gets the data—with no special effort, by the nature of SaaSS.\nWith SaaSS, the server operator can change the software in use on the server. He ought to be able to do this, since it’s his computer; but the result is the same as using a proprietary application program with a universal back door: someone has the power to silently impose changes in how the user’s computing gets done.\nThus, SaaSS is equivalent to running proprietary software with spyware and a universal back door. It gives the server operator unjust power over the user, and that power is something we must resist.\nSaaSS always subjects you to the power of the server operator, and the only remedy is, Don’t use SaaSS! Don’t use someone else’s server to do your own computing on data provided by you.\nThese are selected from Free Software, Free Society and I recommend to read the whole book if you have not already.\nRMS was right, once again. SaaS is dangerous to human liberty and I was aware of it. Since it was called \u0026ldquo;the cloud\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;ve been self-hosting and peer-to-peer everything back that time.\nNowadays, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;Generative AI\u0026rdquo;. This is why the first chapter of my Stable Diffusion article called \u0026ldquo;No DALL-E, No Midjourney and No Colab\u0026rdquo; where talks about neutrality and transparency. AIaaS leaks data and not secure. Not only ChatGPT can become BadGPT, but also open-source LLM can become PoisonGPT. Just like Diffusion models can have malware. Never blindly trust something just because it\u0026rsquo;s open-source.\nHardware Note: This is rather a rough record than a proper guide. Keep in mind, be sure you have enough experience tinkering PC hardware. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.\nDuring the summer, I was working on my research paper and now I have some time back to this fun project.\nAlthough I had some fun and had done quite some projects with it, the biggest con about My mini Server is the VRAM capacity. 4GB is too limiting when I attempt to do training, like LoRA models. Not only that, even using ControlNet or running Open LLM are too restrained. So I decide to buy a NVIDIA Tesla M40, with 24 GB of VRAM which is the largest amount I can get from a cheap single card.\nMoney on the parts ($180-250 in total) :\nDell Optiplex (Sandy Bridge), $0 In my case it\u0026rsquo;s 3010 SFF but other models (7010/9010) would be better On Ebay $40 for whole unit, $20 for motherboard only These models apears in surplus or thrift store quite often With the BIOS hack, neither Above 4G Decoding, Resizable BAR nor pci=realloc are needed NVIDIA Tesla M40 24 GB, $110 Corsair AIO Cooler, $25 It\u0026rsquo;s the cheapest I can find, unknown model The condition is working but looks pretty much AS-IS I refilled it with purified water, checked the seal and pressure tested the pump No mounting bracket and I don\u0026rsquo;t need it either The screw holes on M40 is 58 x 58 mm, the smaller cooler surface the better (need space to put small heatsinks on VRAM chips) A $17 NZXT Kraken G12 is the proper way to go, but those compatible coolers can be expensive even buying used Most CPU AIO coolers would do it though, if using zip tie method Regular CPU air coolers may be too heavy for our card, and the blower fan adapter method is loud, ineffecient yet not cheap Seasonic SSR-550RM, $28 Just a little bit overkill but it\u0026rsquo;s a good deal CPU 8 Pin EPS Cable for Seasonic Modular PSU, $10 Dual PSU Adapter, $9 Optional, bought it for convenience 1TB SATA SSD, $0 Optional, possible to hack in NVMe drives for larger form like 7010/9010 GPU Selection Depending on price, availability and capacity, only K80, M40 and P40 are in my options.\n7xx(Kepler)：Tesla K80 24G 9xx(Maxwell)：Tesla M40 12G/24G，Tesla M4 4G 10x0(Pascal)：Tesla P100 16G，Tesla P40 24G，Tesla P4 8G 20x0(Volta/Turing)：Tesla T4 16G，Tesla V100 16G/32G 30x0(Ampere)：NVIDIA A100 40/80GB，NVIDIA A40 48GB，NVIDIA RTX A6000 48G The best bang for the budget seems like the old good K80, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The driver for Kepler cards are stucked with 440.95.01 and CUDA Toolkit 11.4. Besides that, K80 24G version is actually two 12G versions so it may only recognize half of the VRAM in some application.\nThe problem with Pascal card is that costs more money but not worth it. The support of quantization matters when it comes to AI inference. However, in order to get the performance gain from utilizing quantization. We are not only need to have the supported hardware and use the correct model, but the software needs to support it as well. Eventhough P100 supports FP16 and P40 supports INT8, they are not well supported by the upstream.\nTherefore, if using INT8 or FP16 is not expected, because most of the time it runs with FP32, no reason to spend more on P100 and P40. M40 is the sweet spot without doubt, and it saves a lot of hassle on optimazation. All in all, M40 is great for non-production evironment where performance isn\u0026rsquo;t the priority.\nAbout Power Supply Because there is only a 4+4 pin CPU power cable on my 550w PSU and Tesla cards require CPU\u0026rsquo;s EPS connection. I bought a $7 spliting PCIe to EPS adapter. Sadly, it melt within minutes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very likely that the melting was caused by the copper in the cable was too thin or the resistance of the cable was too high. To power the 250w GPU, a thicker stronger cable is required.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to force the 4+4 pin male connector fit into the 8 pin female socket on the GPU by filing it, but didn\u0026rsquo;t try. Finally, I bought a dedicated modular cable instead of another adapter. It says \u0026ldquo;UL1007 18AWG tinned copper wire with high current terminal\u0026rdquo; that sounds strong enough for the task and it indeed does.\nThe dual PSU adapter is more convenient than a switch jumper cable and safer than a paper clip.\nThermal MOD (Zip-tie Method) When hardware is incompatible, zip tie is our best friend.\nI have talked a lot on the cooling system already. Here just a showcase for my zip tie method mounting any sized AIO cooler, case fan and heat sink.\nIt is quite stable and low-noise. Works on both CPU and GPU. As a bounus, the zip ties also hold up the GPU backplate quite well, and the water pipes can support the GPU to balance its weight if tweaked to a good angle. So, nothing will come loose or bend in a long run.\nIn my CASE, the cardboard box, the cooling is a bit overkill and I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy about 23-26C idle and 46-52C full-load temperature.\nVery cool temperature on idle:\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 535.104.05 Driver Version: 535.104.05 CUDA Version: 12.2 | |-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M | Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

It is actually MECLR1 on my board (right side of the photo).\nAfter updated my BIOS version from A09 to A20, I made a backup using fptw64.exe -d backup.bin.\nNext, follow this DSDT guide but during step 5, after finishing the changes, add some more extra changes from this issue:\nChange If (((MM64 == Zero) || (OSYS \u0026lt;= 0x07D3))) to If (((OSYS \u0026lt;= 0x07D3))) Change ElseIf (E4GM) to Else Remove this section Else { CreateDWordField (BUF0, \\_SB.PCI0._Y0F._LEN, M4LN) // _LEN: Length M4LN = Zero } Continue rest of the steps to finish the DSDT mod, then proceed with UEFI Patch guide to get the patched version of the mod rom.\nFinally, use fptw64.exe -bios -f modpatched.bin to flash the rom.\nFiles I have share all files generated during the process in this repo.\nA20MOD.rom.patched.bin is the binary file named modpatched.bin in the final step above.

So 7B models like h2ogpt-4096-llama2-7b-chat, ehartford/WizardLM-7B-Uncensored or finetuned h2ogpt-oasst1-4096-llama2-7b are more appropriate (costs 14GB VRAM).\nCustom Models h2oGPT web UI provides a large selections of models from huggingface. However, I would like to have some good non-English models in addition.\nNote:\nUnlike FAQ indicated, pre-downloading models to local and passing --model_path is unnecessary. Fine-tuned models is more likely to avoid trashy output For text translation/interpretation/summary, instruction finetuned models are better than chat finetuned models Use --lora_weights= to load a LoRA, --use_safetensors=True when load safetensors Long context version is preferred Recommend to add --prompt_type for custom models following FAQ and this family chart or this evolutionary graph If no prompt type preset, e.g. bloomz-7b1-mt, load the model without passing --prompt_type, go to Expert tab and experiment prompt type in the web ui It shares the same directory as other projects for HF model storage at ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/ Non-English Models Since vanilla Llama2 does not work well responding non-English languages, I have tested a list of Chinese/multilingual LLMs and found some useful result.

Last time I had encountered this sort of situation was over a decade ago with TrueCrypt on an external HDD and unfortunately lost everything that weren\u0026rsquo;t backed up. I\u0026rsquo;ve recovered everything from backup this time so I decide to document it.\nThe entire storage on my daily driver is encrypted with LUKS and it suddenly fails on boot decryption. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the header backed up and have stopped using Timeshift for a long time due to it\u0026rsquo;s unschedulable which lead to chaotic performance impact.\nI believe it\u0026rsquo;s due to physical data corruption on the LUKS header area. The hardware is a very aged low-end TLC NVMe drive (Toshiba BG3) that pulled out of someone\u0026rsquo;s dead laptop. I bought a new replacement by the chance of current SSD price drop. I got a Samsung 970 EVO Plus (1TB) for the same price as my SK hynix Gold S31 (1TB) bought on Black Friday, and it\u0026rsquo;s NVME instead of SATA.\nI do not like to consume on electronics especially buying brand new but sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s literally cheaper than buying used ones. Getting \u0026ldquo;perishable hardware\u0026rdquo; such as SSDs in new condition is more forgiving to me when considering lifespan and reliability factors like TBW and MTBF.\nFortunately, I have the full system backed up within days so I\u0026rsquo;m safe netted against a critical data loss.\nMy backup is made with my favorite tool restic locally:\nrestic --exclude={/dev,/media,/mnt,/proc,/run,/sys,/tmp,/var/tmp} -r /path/to/repository/ backup / Recovery Steps Prepare the New Disk Usually, manual partitioning the new disk, mounting it and then restoring the backup is the way to go. However, with encryption and EFI can make things way more complex. So, I just did a fresh install using a Live CD of the same distro and install restic while the installation.\nRestore the Backup After installation, restore right in the live system:\nrestic --exclude={/boot,/etc/fstab,/etc/crypttab} -r /path/to/repository restore latest -t /new/disk/root/ The exclude will avoid interference of both boot and encryption.\nCover Up Usually, this step involves repairing/rebuilding grub2 and fstab, but that is not the case here.\nAfter rebooting to the restored system on the new disk, the graphics crashed. This results in unable to switch into TTY by CTRL+ALT+F1-12 keys.\nI think it is caused by file corruption occurs around my graphic related files, perhaps driver files.\nSolution:\nReboot to the Grub menu, press \u0026quot;e\u0026quot; to edit boot options Remove quiet and add 3 in the end Press Ctrl+X to boot into the system without crashing the graphic driver Switch to TTY and reinstall the corrupted driver, in my case remove mesa-dri-drivers and install mesa-dri-drivers I believe excluding/usr/lib64/dri during the restore process may prevent it but it won\u0026rsquo;t happen again.\nI still need to repair my network drive in fstab and that is it.

Thanks for Daniela Baron\u0026rsquo;s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.\nHey everyone. Well, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if anyone is interested in that direction, but I digressed, let\u0026rsquo;s get to start.\nThis beautiful artwork is generated by me, using an AI tool called Stable Diffusion, with these generation info. Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if any of you have been got your hands on it, or been using something similar like Midjourney, but it\u0026rsquo;s stunningly amazing.\nWhat you see here is a a humanoid AI robot from Dystopian future, standing face-to-face with a wasteland scavenging survivor from post-apocalyptic future. What I\u0026rsquo;m trying to express here is that, although they are confronting each other, but they really have no clue whether the other is a friend or foe.\nWhy, you may ask? Because one thing they both are pretty damn sure about is, the great catastrophe either already happened or is about to happen, is caused by human.\nAnyway, let\u0026rsquo;s put that thought on hold for now and get to the main topic of our today\u0026rsquo;s lecture - AI and cyber security, also some philosophy thinking.\nInsead of introducing myself in a old fasion, does anyone know what Shinobi means? It also relates to our topic. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it in the end.\nReconnaissance Introduction of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) So, I\u0026rsquo;ve been informed that this course is about reconnaissance. Now, to be honest, this term has always reminded me of the military more than anything else. Although the infosec industry has been heavily influenced by the presence of prior military personnel and government agencies, at the end of the day, it still falls under the umbrella of the IT industry.\nNow, back in the day when I was learning ethical hacking like a decade ago, it was called Footprinting. It involved a variety of techniques such as port scanning, network mapping, and intel collection.\nBack in the old days, there was no social media around. You can\u0026rsquo;t just go online and Google it or check on your collection of leaked datasets. But let me tell you, if you wanted to collect information on someone, you had to go dumpster diving. Yes, you heard that right. Teachers and textbooks would tell you, literally, to collect intel in the trash cans. And believe it or not, it is still effective today. But we just don\u0026rsquo;t have to do that anymore. Because we have better ways now.\nWhat we have now is Open-Source Intelligence, or OSINT for short. And trust me, this technique is the way to go. If you want to learn more about it, there\u0026rsquo;s a link down below that will provide you the full version of the lecture.\nSources for OSINT Here\u0026rsquo;re some common sources that you can tap into.\nNeeds for OSINT Let\u0026rsquo;s look at who might need to conduct OSINT operations.\nStages of the Intelligence Cycle Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the five stages of the Intelligence Cycle. These stages are pretty self-explanatory and should be easy to understand. You may come across some variations of this, but they should all look pretty similar.\nPassive vs Active OSINT Next, we have passive versus active. As you may already know, this is the fundamental concept when you collecting information for your attack or pentesting. No matter in the cyberspace or physical world, this concept should remains the same.\nAI-OSINT Now, here\u0026rsquo;s the AI kicks in. You can use tools like ChatGPT to generate a perfect profile for your Alias account, and it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to identify it\u0026rsquo;s a fake person.\nYou can even create video and audio contents using Synthesia or D-ID to make it even more convincing. This is a powerful tool for social engineering attacks, and it\u0026rsquo;s important to be aware of these techniques.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re like me, living far away from your family, it\u0026rsquo;s important to prepare some secret words with them, in case they are targeted by someone using AI with your voice or video. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to protect yourself and your loved ones from these types of attacks, especially if they\u0026rsquo;re not as tech-savvy as you are.\nIt can also be used to bypass security check or generating disinformation as a countermeasure to protect something you can\u0026rsquo;t simply remove from the public.\nMore Use cases Here are some tips for AI-OSINT. PimEyes is a popular option to find more photos of someone by reverse searching just like tineye. However, we also need to verify that the information we find belongs to a real person. With the increasing capability of AI, this can be difficult.\nChatGPT is still locked without internet access but it will be able to do that sooner or later. In the meantime, tools like GPT4 or the microsoft alternative can be used for AI-OSINT with extra layers of protection from regulations. But this window won\u0026rsquo;t be long, and please be a decent person, do things legally. You will get caught if your countersurveillance skill is not better than your offensive skills.\nEven if you\u0026rsquo;re doing white hat gigs for helping some entity to do pentesting or bug bounty, and you think you are completely legal and moral and you\u0026rsquo;re doing the right thing. You can still get into troubles because others don\u0026rsquo;t think so, and the law doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily work for good people with the best intentions. Unfortunately, sometimes, it can be the opposite.\nOkay, back to the topic, ChatGPT writes really good script code in python and powershell. The explanation and commenting for the code is god like, so if you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner, go try it out if you have not already.\nMore tools Here are some more tools if you would like to further exploring OSINT.\nSpiderFoot is an incredibly versatile OSINT toolkit, and you can find more tools like that in these two links.\nThe SANS OSINT Summit is an annual event hosted by the SANS Institute, and they\u0026rsquo;re currently accepting applications for this year. So if you\u0026rsquo;re into OSINT, don\u0026rsquo;t miss it.\nFor those more interested in privacy and cyber hygiene rather than proactive OSINT, there are a couple of sites that you might want to check out. These two sites are great to have. Both of them are relatively late comers but they\u0026rsquo;re more focused on helping average people rather than tech savvy ones. The OSINT show and techlore can teach you everything from choosing the right web browser, instant messenger, VPN, and email provider, to operating systems and private phone ROMs. They offer videos, podcasts, books, and community forums for you to engage with.\nNow, If online privacy and anonymity is not your thing, then check out this document from NSA, yes, you heard it right, it\u0026rsquo;s from the NSA ! And surprisingly, they\u0026rsquo;re really teaching you how to secure your home network and it\u0026rsquo;s very comprehensive. So, give it a shot if you think there are too many smart/backdoored IoT devices in your home that can invite attackers to outsmart you.\nIntroduction of ChatGPT Alright, now we\u0026rsquo;re getting to the hot topic. Unless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard of it by now. So I won\u0026rsquo;t waste your time by repeating something you can easily find online or get answered by ChatGPT itself.\nUse cases Basically, these are what you can do with ChatGPT for now.\nDepends on whether you\u0026rsquo;re on the Blue team or the Red team, you can either find vulnerabilities or do threat hunting with it, Write Exploits or Patches, create Malware code or Incident response plan, generate phishing emails or filtering rules, and deliver payload or get alert from logs.\nThese are nothing new to the cybersec industry. Many SaaS products on the market have already implemented machine learning features for years. The new AI language model may not be as robust as the those solutions, but it can do much more. Or it\u0026rsquo;s more like a so-called general AI, which is more versatile than the older ones. Therefore, the new AI does not replace the old ML systems but rather enhances and integrates them.\nMore use cases If I have a whole semester to teach this lecture, I would like to login and show you some prompt engineering right now. Unfortunately, not today. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve compiled a list of links to some excellent video lectures on that. These lectures cover use case examples for prompt engineering and also discuss the ethics of it.\nFor those interested in the architecture and training of AI models, the first video goes into detail on those topics.\nThe fourth video focuses on creating SOPs(standard operating procedures) for IRTs(incident response teams), which can be quite challenging to manage. ChatGPT can greatly assist with it.\nIn the fifth video, they create logic apps for threat intelligence using a CSV fine-tune training file. This is a more advanced use case than the others.\nThe last video covers creating phishing emails, polymorphic malware, and pentesting with Nmap automating scripts. They also discuss human-machine intelligence, which combines people, processes, and AI, and how to train a good model.\nRisks If you\u0026rsquo;re already in the cybersecurity field, then you\u0026rsquo;re probably aware of the saying:\n\u0026ldquo;There is no silver bullet.\u0026rdquo;\nBut in the real world, it\u0026rsquo;s even more complex than that and I\u0026rsquo;d like to add onto that:\n\u0026ldquo;There is not only no silver bullet, but also everything is a double-edged sword.\u0026rdquo;\nThis idea is actually came from Sigmund Freud, he said:\n\u0026ldquo;If a knife does not cut, it cannot be used for healing either.\u0026rdquo;\nFor those who does not familiar with psychoanalysis —it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much like what we do in cybersecurity.\nIn the first link, the word OPWNAI is pretty funny that made by some genius from checkpoint research. And I also did my own investigation on how ChatGPT can be abused by black hat in the second link.\nAt the bottom, I put a link to alert people who still trust in OpenAI blindly. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into that further.\nOpenAI\u0026rsquo;s data breach As many of you may already know, there was a data breach of OpenAI recently. And let me tell you, the way they respond to the public is absolutely unacceptable for the open source community and that reveals what the company really is.\nEven if you don\u0026rsquo;t care about how AI will impact our future, it\u0026rsquo;s still worth to watch this video just for fun. It\u0026rsquo;s only about 3 minutes: How ChatGPT lied like hell to Professor Doug White about OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s recent data breach.\nAt the bottom of the page, we have two comments from Open Source Security Podcast and me.\nIn the podcast, they said:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid of ChatGPT. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of OpenIA.\u0026rdquo;\nIn my blog post, I emphasized that:\n\u0026ldquo;AI itself is not a threat, but the capital behind it.\u0026rdquo;\nThe technology is only as good or bad as the people behind it, and the motivations driving them. Go listen or read the whole thing if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in.\nDeep-dive into Thinking Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s relax and have some fun. Can anyone recognize these gang of four in this image?\nFrom the left, where is Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud. You may be curious why the hell these four gansters came together. Let\u0026rsquo;s find that out.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re getting into some heavy philosophical territory.\nThe death of the subject is a pretty depressing idea that basically says that our free will is nihilated or nullified by external factors like social culture, the language we speak, and our past experiences. In other words, we\u0026rsquo;re not as unique as we thought we were.\nPosthumanism takes a step further by denying the special status of Homo sapiens and accepting that AI could be the successor of humanity. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s right, the robots will bring our civilization into the next level and the historical responsibility of Homo sapiens is sadly going to the end.\nTranshumanism is just the philosophy term for cyborg, it\u0026rsquo;s the transition period before posthumanism. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already got a RFID chip implanted under your skin, congratulations, you\u0026rsquo;re on your way to becoming a cyborg. And Singularity is usually considered as the point of AGI or strong AI come out.\nSo there you have it. Some heavy stuff huh? Let\u0026rsquo;s see how people talking about it.\nMore Thinking Alright everyone, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many of you are already deep into this train of thought or if you\u0026rsquo;re completely against it, but I\u0026rsquo;ve got some links to a few lectures of art, education, society, and more.\nNow, there\u0026rsquo;s a quote I came across from Plastic Pills that I think is worth pondering on:\n\u0026ldquo;Socrates tells a myth that before his time, the technology of writing is something that needs to be rejected. Because the technology of writing is going to destroy Humanity. Paradoxically, perhaps our definition of humanity today that it\u0026rsquo;s about to be destroyed is literacy.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not saying to support on any side, but I do think there are more crucial issues that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t ignore.\nArendt and Heidegger Listen up. Let\u0026rsquo;s face it, the dangers of technology. As Hannah Arendt said in her book, The Life of the Mind:\n\u0026ldquo;The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to Martin Heidegger as well:\n\u0026ldquo;The danger of technology does not lie in technology itself. The essence of technology is by no means anything technological.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother quote from his book, The Question Concerning Technology, where he said:\n\u0026ldquo;Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it.\nBut we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly pay homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s not forget the historical context of Heidegger\u0026rsquo;s words. He wrote them in the aftermath of World War II, which saw the horrors of gas chambers and atomic bombs.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s world is not far from the great catastrophe in each direction. So, it\u0026rsquo;s important not to tunnel vision on AI itself, but use the technology as a tool of revealing, to uncover what was hidden and concealed.\nThe real threat Here is a great documentary and some comedy shows you can learn from. Surveillance capitalism is already there, behind the scene and stealing freedom and democracy from every single one of us. This is not a conspiracy theory at all, otherwise Edward Snowden shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in Russia.\nTeaser for Reading Books If you\u0026rsquo;re a book reader or wanna become one. Try watch these videos and pick up some books mentioned.\nChomsky understands language and the world\u0026rsquo;s current condition quite well. He thinks ChatGPT is far from human mind and no need to worry about. The real threat to us, to our civilization are Climate Crisis, international conflicts, nuclear war, dominant political and economic systems of the world, decline of the democracy and growing inequality of wealth and power.\nAlso here is a interesting talk between Slavoj Žižek and Yuval Harari. Zizek is considered the most dangerous or funniest philosopher today and Harari is the author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. It\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating conversation to watch.\nIn the second video of Zizek, he said \u0026ldquo;Sometimes, the most violent thing is to do nothing.\u0026rdquo; and I agree with him. So, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we can do to overcome this unpleasant situation.\nMaking a difference First, don\u0026rsquo;t give money to OpenAI or try to pay less if you\u0026rsquo;ve already built something on it.\nSecond, contribute or support free open source software ecosystem or so called FOSS. Consider using real open source alternatives to build your project. Here are two links you can find GPT alternatives like Alpaca and LLaMA.\nThe third link is a tutorial of using Stable Diffusion on your own device, rather than paid services like Midjourney or DALL-E. By the way, it\u0026rsquo;s wrote by me. If you think it\u0026rsquo;s helpful, please share it on reddit, hacker news or other social medias you like.\nThen, consider participate or support EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation to defend digital privacy, free speech and regain the freedom we\u0026rsquo;re losing.\nMaking more difference If you\u0026rsquo;re a hacker who runs or wants to start up your own company or organization, try to build on a Business Model that is more open and democratic. If you\u0026rsquo;re a hacker who just want a fair workplace, try to join a company with such attributes.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some videos to learn from if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in. And remember hackers, we have the potential to shape the world around us. Let\u0026rsquo;s do this together.\nMore resources for hackers And more websites for those who really serious about it.\nAbout me Alright, I didn\u0026rsquo;t provide an introduction earlier, and I won\u0026rsquo;t bother with one now.\nI refuse to be put in a box, and I\u0026rsquo;m not easily labeled. What\u0026rsquo;s important is what I bring to the table, not what you call me. I believe what I do and what I say speak for it. That\u0026rsquo;s all that really matters in the end.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s head back to the meaning of Shinobi. That\u0026rsquo;s just a traditional way to say ninjia. Which means not only being stealthy, but to bear something, or to suppress, restrain oneself.\nIts Chinese character constructs as a heart under blade —『刃の下に心あり』.\nTo me, the blade is a metaphor of technology, such as tools or weaponry. While the heart is a metaphor of our mind, will or spirit. This is the opposite of cold rationality, reason, intelligence, or logic—which even a strong AI can never match. That\u0026rsquo;s the humanity we should preserve and taking care of, not the other way around.\nLet us not forget the irrational and unconscious parts of ourselves that make us what we are, such as our being and existence, love and devotion, ethics and determination, faith and religion. These aspects of humanity are far from the animal instincts or excessive radicalism. This cannot be fully expressed in words, so sometimes it is better to remain silent, as Wittgenstein said.\nIf you need, both the slides and texts are on my blog. Thanks for your patient.\nStable Diffusion Generation info Generated with my Cheapskate\u0026rsquo;s Mini Server.

ChatGPT, how did you get here? It was a long journey through open source AI When big AI labs refuse to open source their models, the community steps in Artificial Intelligence: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO) The TRUTH about OpenAI I have been using ChatGPT and its API regulary. Since my last post, the API has been upgraded to gpt-3.5-turbo which broke my program and gpt-4 seems coming up soon. Therefore, I may not fix my code proactively.\nI also built a customized chatbot project which was running on the web version of ChatGPT. However, one day it suddenly got blocked by OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s cloudflare filter.\nI believe that was done on purpose —by tightening up the IP range of all popular VPN providers. I have to switch over to a proxy login endpoint https://bypass.duti.tech/api/, thanks to acheong08\u0026rsquo;s Reverse engineered ChatGPT API. By doing this, it compromises some of security but it\u0026rsquo;s better than using the paid API.\nThe reason why I keep trying this route is not just for saving money, but to counter attack against the Big Tech companies.\nThere are a list of alternatives to OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s GPT. I would like to test llama.cpp sometime, as it can run on as low-profile as a Raspberry Pi.\nThe stand I\u0026rsquo;m taking is simple. I love the technology but I have problem with big tech company. I\u0026rsquo;ll work against it unless the product goes truly open source and their business model goes nonprofit —because neutrality and transparency is crucial for such technology.\nAI itself is not a threat but the capital behind it.\nHardware Requirements This article is for both old GPUs and CPU. If using a GPU, make sure it supports FP16. Otherwise, just run it on CPU regardless because it will run into VRAM issues.\n2GB or larger Nvidia card of Maxwell 1 (745, 750, and 750ti)\nAccording to this buying guide, my spare GTX 750 Ti with 2GB VRAM is the oldest GPU that supports FP16.\nRAM size should be larger than 8GB. According to my test, 4GB won\u0026rsquo;t even run and 8GB works only with small models. So 12~16GB is the minimum for non-testing.\nHard drive is not important, minimum is 20GB (debian clean install + base sd-webui + 2 pruned models).\nUsing SSD can increase the speed of loading weights (switching models) but not the generating speed.\nMy mini Server Build Because of the 2GB VRAM on 750ti is barely enough for real production (Restore faces+Hires. fix+VAE+LoRA+multi-ControlNet+inpainting+upscaling). After working for hours, SD crashes quite often. Therefore, I had to heavily rely on my Self-Healing Daemon.\nFinally, I decided to build a dedicated GPU server which is smaller and more capable for various AI projects.\nHP Z2 G4 Mini Workstation - $85 Barebones w/o AC adapter C246 Chipset w/ P600 Mobile GPU (rare 4GB version) HP 230W Power Supply - $18 19.5V 11.8A 7.4mm x 5.0mm Connector HSTNN-xxxx for EliteBook Mobile Workstations Intel Pentium Gold G5420 $22 3.8 GHz 2 cores 4 threads 54W LGA1151 revision 2 for Coffee Lake Spare RAM sticks - $0/$40 DDR4 16+4GB 2133MHz SODIMM Spare SSD - $0/$30 512GB NVMe M.2 2280 Total cost for me is about $120. For buying everything from scratch would be around $200.\nNote:\nThese are all used parts on ebay, so price and availability changes quite a bit. Performance should be similar between different Pascal mobile GPUs, e.g. Quadro P500, P520, P600, P620, P1000, MX1x0 and GTX10x0. Even between Maxwell (750ti) and Pascal (P600), I don\u0026rsquo;t gain noticible speed improvement but doubled VRAM for capability. CPU does not matter for SD running on GPU mode. So Pentium/Celeron is good enough for generating images. However, using tensorflow based tools like Dreambooth (for training) requires CPU to support AVX Instructions. In this case, i3-8100 or Xeon E-2124 (more $$) can be considered, however, software workaround is also available for tinkers. Although I don\u0026rsquo;t intend to do any training on this build. Creativity takes time to think and plan before take the shot. People who like spray and pray tend to spend more and hope for the best but it\u0026rsquo;s far from the way. Both bolt-action and full-auto have their value, but I\u0026rsquo;d perfer doing it just right. Asuka Benchmark If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the naming, never mind, it\u0026rsquo;s just the \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; test for SD, a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;hello asuka\u0026rdquo; test.\nThis was the gold standard in the community.\nSampler: Euler Seed: 2870305590 CFG: 12 Resolution: 512x512 Prompt: masterpiece, best quality, masterpiece, asuka langley sitting cross legged on a chair Negative Prompt: lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts,signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name Results:\nRun on Quadro P600 (384CUDA4G) - 0:56 per asuka, 2.80s/it Run on GTX 750 Ti (640CUDA2G) - 1:09 per asuka, 3.47s/it Run on E5-2670 (8C16T) - 3:45 per asuka, 10s/it Run on E3-1245 (4C8T) - 5:30 per asuka, 16s/it Run on i5-2300 (4C4T) - 6:40 per asuka, 20s/it Run on i5-2520M (2C4T) - 12:30 per asuka, 37s/it Run on G5420 (2C4T) - 12:50 per asuka, 38s/it Installation Debian Linux Why Linux?\nBecause it runs efficient and open-source.\nWhy Debian?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried RPM distros and that didn\u0026rsquo;t went well. Then I found the script says:\nTested on Debian 11 (Bullseye)\nSo just go to debian.org and get debian-11.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso\nUse Etcher or Rufus to flash the ISO file into a USB drive\nBoot into the USB installer we just created and select Graphical install\nBefore going into the network configuring step, connect the Ethernet cable so this can let it configure network interfaces automatically.\nAfter setup root and user credentials, I used entire disk while partitioning since this device is dedicated for SD.\nOther steps are good by default. Except software selection.\nDo not install any desktop environment since it may cause trouble while installing graphics driver later on.\nEnable SSH server because we want to use SD from other machines within a local network.\nWhile installing GRUB, in my case the HDD is /dev/sda.\nAfter installation finish and reboot, log in with root account.\nRun apt-get install sudo -y then usermod -aG sudo username to add the user account as sudoer.

Cases could be:\nSending to img2img/inpaint/sketch back and forth Increasing Batch size or Width/Height Using SD upscale script with large Batch count Using large size ControlNet models (only with control_*.safetensors, coadapter-*.pth and t2iadapter_*.safetensors work fine even with muli-controlnet) Working with caution can avoid the issue most of the time. When CUDA out of memory occurs, just refresh the web page and generate again. If it persist, go to SSH, Ctrl+C to terminate webui process and ./webui.sh to restart.\nHowever, when I need to use those large controlnet models, such as normal,hed,mlsd and scribble. I have to switch the COMMANDLINE_ARGS into CPU only. By this way, cpu mode can handle larger model and heavier load by using RAM as VRAM. Therefore, the capacity increases from 2GB to 16GB at the cost of slow generating.\nBasic Usage Open the IP 192.168.1.x:7860 from a modern browser to start using SD.\nFrom the SD server machine or through SSH, run watch -n 2 nvidia-smi to monitor the GPU status. For CPU usage, simply use top or apt install bpytop then bpytop.\nGo to Civitai and Hugging Face to find and download models. Use wget or git-lfs to download models via SSH directly onto the server. Or use scp/rsync/sftp/syncthing to transfer files between local and remote.\nFor Civitai, right click Download button and Copy Link, then go to SSH run wget https://civitai.com/api/download/models/xxxxx --content-disposition. For Hugging Face, just use \u0026lsquo;wget\u0026rsquo; with raw file link.\nFor example, if you want to batch download a collection of anime models, use git clone https://huggingface.co/AIARTCHAN/aichan_blend then mv aichan_blend/*.safetensors stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion/\nTo batch download ControlNet models, use git clone https://huggingface.co/webui/ControlNet-modules-safetensors then mv T2I-Adapter/models/*.safetensors stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/sd-webui-controlnet/models/\nGo to the official wiki to find and download extensions or use the webui built-in extensions page.\nUse git pull to update the webui when needed.\nManage/remove styles by nano stable-diffusion-webui/styles.csv\nLearn more from the SD RESOURCE GOLDMINE and Educational MegaGrid.\nControlNet Learn everything from these:\nControlNet: Control human pose in Stable Diffusion A1111 ControlNet extension - explained like you\u0026rsquo;re 5 Dummy ControlNet guide NEXT-GEN MULTI-CONTROLNET INPAINTING Preprocessor and Model Combinations:\ncanny -\u0026gt; control_canny - t2iadapter_canny mlsd -\u0026gt; control_mlsd hed -\u0026gt; control_hed scribble -\u0026gt; control_scribble - t2iadapter_sketch fake_scribble -\u0026gt; control_scribble - t2iadapter_sketch openpose -\u0026gt; control_openpose - t2iadapter_openpose - t2iadapter_keypose openpose_hand -\u0026gt; control_openpose - t2iadapter_openpose segmentation -\u0026gt; control_seg - t2iadapter_seg depth -\u0026gt; control_depth - t2iadapter_depth depth_leres -\u0026gt; control_depth - t2iadapter_depth depth_leres_boost -\u0026gt; control_depth - t2iadapter_depth normal_map -\u0026gt; control_normal binary -\u0026gt; control_scribble - t2iadapter_sketch color -\u0026gt; t2iadapter_color pidinet -\u0026gt; control_hed clip_vision -\u0026gt; t2iadapter_style Self-Healing Daemon To make webui auto restart in the background when it crashes, we need to use another script.

They\u0026rsquo;re not as good as the official model text-davinci-003 after all as my previous post said.\nWhy use API instead of the Ordinary Way After OpenAI fired up their paid subscription for ChatGPT, availability issue like response error, rate limit and throttling become more often.\nThe current cost of ChatGPT Plus is $20 per month. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it worth it. Since it has been, and will become more regulated. In today\u0026rsquo;s world, there is no free speech for such an AI.\nUsing API to interact with the AI is my backup method when I can\u0026rsquo;t get access to the official ChatGPT web app.\nThere was one time I got \u0026ldquo;Chat GPT is at capacity right now.\u0026rdquo; while working on something pressing.\nFurthermore, the block list of the notorious safeguard on ethical or political sensitive content is quickly growing. Alongside of that, safeguard on cybercrime safety control is getting severer as well.\nHowever, this makes things harder for both threat actors and security researchers. I\u0026rsquo;ll put my Comparison Tests at the end.\nEasiest Way to use the API Most projects which let users to use their OpenAI API are barebone tools written in python, node.js, golang, or at least a shell script. These tools usually runs inside a terminal or command prompt.\nThey are NOT user-friendly at all. Not only because of they require cli skills to interact with, but also difficult to work with when copy-pasting with large amount of texts.\nAfter some experiments with the playground, I decide to find a portable, secure, and stable way to use the API.\nAfter testing and inspecting a few available tools that are based on web page— HTML-ChatGPT-3.js is the best one on GitHub, a lot of thanks to sdsds222\u0026rsquo;s great effort.\nIts a Chinese project so I let ChatGPT translated all UI texts into English. I also did a few modifications to parameters and visual experiences to fit my taste.

This phone runs smoothly with jailbreak iOS 6.1.3. It was siting in my nostalgia box for years and has never been my daily driver.\nBack in time, I was a big fun of Motorola Milestone/Droid series and my main phone was the last of these QWERTY phones, Photon Q (XT897). Its keyboard was fantastic and CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4 KitKat) with XPosed framework was perfect in both productivity and aesthetics.\nMy final QWERTY phone is Nokia N900 since Motorola no longer making them. This is a phone from 2009 but I bought it after my Photon Q was broken. It was cheap compare to Neo900 and runs Maemo 5 or other open-source systems such as Firefox Mobile, Ubuntu and Kali Linux. Speaking of Neo900, it makes me remember the X62, a ThinkPad Mod.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like to mod hardware just to keep up with the software, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer the opposite.\nI really like the idea from cheapskatesguide and lowtechmagazine that could save people from the pitfalls of consumerism. Moreover, to me it\u0026rsquo;s not about saving money on technology nor adapting certain lifestyles. This is a manifestation of ideology, the way of pursuing freedom.\n0x01 Maemo 5 Factory Reset This step is optional but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to have a clean, latest base system to start with.\nThe official guide is very well written but those download links are already down.\nI found maemo flasher 3.5 from github with additional useful information and firmware files, also its archive.\nWith the flasher tool and two .bin files, I can follow this guide to perform the reset/upgrade.\nflasher-3.5 -F RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1_PR_COMBINED_MR0_ARM.bin -f flasher-3.5 -F RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.13-2.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin -f -R 0x02 Flashing postmarketOS I used the SD card method and downloaded the image file from official site.\nAfter checksum, I need to use lsblk to find and edit the dd target /dev/sdx.\nsha512sum 20221005-1522-postmarketOS-edge-i3wm-0.3-nokia-n900.img.xz xzcat 20221005-1522-postmarketOS-edge-i3wm-0.3-nokia-n900.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdx status=progress bs=1M While flashing the SD card, I can prepare the root access on Maemo by Open App manager - Update - Download - System - Sudser , this needs Wi-Fi connection.\nEither Sudser or rootsh would work, and they need \u0026ldquo;Extras repository\u0026rdquo; to download. Which should be already included with the latest firmware RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.xx.\nIn case of adding Extras manually, Open App manager - Click title bar drop-down menu - Application catalogues - New and input these then Update:\nCatalogue name: Extras Web address: http://repository.maemo.org/extras/ Distribution: fremantle Components: free non-free 0x03 Boot into U-Boot Now, power off, put the SD card with fresh postmarketOS into the phone and turn back on Maemo, Open X terminal and execute:\nsudo apt-get install u-boot-flasher If Sudser was installed properly, sudo command should go through without password prompt.\nAfter installation of u-boot, configure the entry menu by sudo vi /etc/bootmenu.d/10-pmos.item\nITEM_NAME=\u0026#34;postmarketOS\u0026#34; ITEM_SCRIPT=\u0026#34;boot.scr\u0026#34; ITEM_DEVICE=\u0026#34;${EXT_CARD}p1\u0026#34; ITEM_FSTYPE=\u0026#34;ext2\u0026#34; Create link\nsudo ln -s /etc/bootmenu.d/10-pmos.item /etc/default/bootmenu.item Update changes\nu-boot-update-bootmenu Finally, reboot the phone into the U-boot bootloader menu and boot postmarketOS.\n0x04 Usage of postmarketOS Like the official wiki, there are other articles about N900 with pmOS but solely focuses on installation rather than post-installation. People on YouTube either frustrated by stucking at the i3wm wallpaper or showing off their magical techniques. I like freedom and openess, not gatekeeping. This is the motivation behind this post.\nThe blue arrow key in combination with the Volume Up/Down to switch to a different virtual terminal.

I did my own test anyway, that netsurf is the fastest one for simple web pages and midori is the only working one for \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo;(heavy) web pages.\nThere are also text-based browsers like vimb, w3m and lynx.

Run it withpmos-tweaks instead of its full name.\nSometimes I get connection aborted/ IO error when using sudo apk add, So I have to retry multiple times. Using sudo apk fetch instead may work better, or troubleshooting the network.\nIt maybe interesting to try install xfce4 on N900 but I feel good with i3wm for now.\nAfter installing everything, clean up the cache either by\nsudo apk -v cache clean or\nsudo rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* Then check the storage usage\ndf -h I\u0026rsquo;m using a good old humble 4GB Toshiba Class-4.

My complain is just because my multi-boot hard drive has a very complex partition structure where an advanced installer is needed.\nThe driver support of Kali Linux is also inferior to Parrot OS. I have to prepare or install the wlan driver manually although it\u0026rsquo;s a common problem with Broadcom chips.\nUnfortunately, This auto installing script did not work and sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer worked partially.\nThe wlan adapter wouldn\u0026rsquo;t connect to a router with 802.11 N only mode.

VPN provides good security against MITM attacks but in case of privacy and tracking, VPNs can\u0026rsquo;t compete with TOR at all. When needed, it\u0026rsquo;s better to have both VPN and TOR at the same time to maximize security and privacy.\nIn my case, I just need TOR running system-wide (a.k.a. Torification) like Whonix or Tails. The built-in Anonsurf is the main reason I had been using Parrot OS. Thanks to Und3rf10w maintaining kali-anonsurf so I can still have Anonsurf around even without Parrot OS.\nInstallation is easy by following this guide but it\u0026rsquo;s not as handy as in Parrot OS where I can run anonsurf with one-click.\nSo I made a simple script for that reason.\nFirst, create anonsurf.sh by nano or text editor with contents below:\n#!/bin/sh sudo anonsurf start sudo anonsurf myip sudo anonsurf status Save it and chmod +x anonsurf.sh in case of permission issue.\nThen, create a shortcut on taskbar:\nPanel - Add New Items - Launcher - Properties - Add a new empty item\nName: anonsurf Command: /path/to/anonsurf.sh Icon: network-disconnect check Run in terminal Done. Now by clicking the shortcut, it will start anonsurf and show connection info within terminal. Close the window and run it again will change to another node automatically.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to set the script auto start with the system but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to run it manually with one-click shortcut button.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/kalianon/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"kali-linux--freshtomato\"\u003eKali Linux \u0026amp; FreshTomato\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParrot OS was on my old ThinkPad for many years.

That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m kind of picky on computer mouses and being paranoid of acceleration in the OS.\nPermanently disabling acceleration for Windows is simple. Besides unchecking the \u0026ldquo;Enhance pointer precision\u0026rdquo; in the main.cpl, some registry hacks such as the good old classic \u0026ldquo;CPL Mouse Fix\u0026rdquo; or the later \u0026ldquo;MarkC\u0026rdquo; would do it easily by a REG/batch file. It is also possible doing manually if you want.\nHowever, this is much harder for Linux.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t express more that how much I rely on ArchWiki when tweaking any Linux-based system. By following the wiki page, I can temporarily accomplish the result but failed autostarting 50-mouse-acceleration.conf to preserve the result after rebooting.\njagardaniel is my savior by sharing this script on reddit. My only change is the device name (find it by xinput --list) and Accel Speed:\n#!/bin/sh device=\u0026#34;my mouse\u0026#34; if xinput list --id-only \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1; then xinput --set-prop \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;libinput Accel Profile Enabled\u0026#39; 0, 1 xinput --set-prop \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;libinput Accel Speed\u0026#39; 0 notify-send \u0026#34;Mouse settings applied\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;Unable to find device ${device}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit 1 fi After saving it, run chmod +x script.sh from terminal to ensure its permission and add it into Startup Applications Preferences. This works perfectly.\nTrackball This method of autostarting script also works with my Kensington trackball thanks for ArtiomSu creating this fantastic script.

Therefore, one universal gesture tool that runs at desktop/system level is necessary. For Windows, there are many choices and I use StrokesPlus.\nHowever, for Linux, it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to find any alternative.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried easystroke which is no longer maintained for many years. It works very well and has all the functions I needed. Unfortunately, there is one problem ruined everything. It crashes randomly and kills the Xorg/X11 server. That results rebooting of the desktop environment and send me back to the log-in window while force quitting all running processes.\nThis can be disastrous while working and it happens so randomly that is very difficult to troubleshoot with.\nI had to fall back to browser extensions and set them up one by one. There are two open source options, Gesturefy for Firefox-based, smartUp for Chromium-based and no love for Webkit. They are great compare to other extensions and by design there is NO extensions that work with loading page and internal pages. So I have to keep pressing Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab when I have to.\nMaybe I can find/create something better in the future.\nTrackPoint There are also problems with Windows undoubtedly. The TrackPoint on my old ThinkPad is a big one, especially with newer versions of Windows 10. Although I can make it work perfectly by sneak the outdated Synaptics and UltraNav into the newer OS, the process is tedious and painful.\nI also use portable USB keyboards with TrackPoint so a light and portable solution is needed. My requirement is simple, just to make the TrackPoint behave like under most Linux desktop:\nMove to scroll while holding down the middle button Perform middle click as a mouse wheel An AutoHotkey script works great and easy to set up.\nFirst, install the latest AHK 1.x from its release page\nThen, download the script and simply run it to try and tweak.

[{"content":"Kali Linux \u0026amp; FreshTomato Parrot OS was on my old ThinkPad for many years. I recently upgraded it and had some issue with my multi-bootloader. Although it\u0026rsquo;s not Parrot OS\u0026rsquo;s fault, I switched to Kali Linux as a workaround.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using this pentesting system since early BackTrack era but never felt it ought to be installed on a hard drive.\nThe graphic installer is much simpler than Parrot OS that may not be an issue for most people. My complain is just because my multi-boot hard drive has a very complex partition structure where an advanced installer is needed.\nThe driver support of Kali Linux is also inferior to Parrot OS. I have to prepare or install the wlan driver manually although it\u0026rsquo;s a common problem with Broadcom chips.\nUnfortunately, This auto installing script did not work and sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer worked partially.\nThe wlan adapter wouldn\u0026rsquo;t connect to a router with 802.11 N only mode. It only connects with Auto or B/G mixed mode. This is acceptable since I just need to tweak settings in the router system freshtomato. Basic - Network - Wireless eth - Wireless Network Mode - Auto In this case I don\u0026rsquo;t care much about network performance.\nAnonsurf To be honest, I only use this system occasionally. So as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not rolling release, I\u0026rsquo;m OK with it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s glad to have those pre-installed VPN clients but I still miss Anonsurf from Parrot OS. VPN provides good security against MITM attacks but in case of privacy and tracking, VPNs can\u0026rsquo;t compete with TOR at all. When needed, it\u0026rsquo;s better to have both VPN and TOR at the same time to maximize security and privacy.\nIn my case, I just need TOR running system-wide (a.k.a. Torification) like Whonix or Tails. The built-in Anonsurf is the main reason I had been using Parrot OS. Thanks to Und3rf10w maintaining kali-anonsurf so I can still have Anonsurf around even without Parrot OS.\nInstallation is easy by following this guide but it\u0026rsquo;s not as handy as in Parrot OS where I can run anonsurf with one-click.\nSo I made a simple script for that reason.\nFirst, create anonsurf.sh by nano or text editor with contents below:\n#!/bin/sh sudo anonsurf start sudo anonsurf myip sudo anonsurf status Save it and chmod +x anonsurf.sh in case of permission issue.\nThen, create a shortcut on taskbar:\nPanel - Add New Items - Launcher - Properties - Add a new empty item\nName: anonsurf Command: /path/to/anonsurf.sh Icon: network-disconnect check Run in terminal Done. Now by clicking the shortcut, it will start anonsurf and show connection info within terminal. Close the window and run it again will change to another node automatically.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to set the script auto start with the system but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to run it manually with one-click shortcut button.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/kalianon/","summary":"Kali Linux \u0026amp; FreshTomato Parrot OS was on my old ThinkPad for many years.

The TTS engine made by Microsoft sounds incomparable to those poorly made chrome extensions.\nTherefore, I found a work around with edge-tts. This is a CLI tool uses Edge TTS service. The instruction on its Github repo is very good.\nAfter installation, use edge-tts --list-voices | grep US to show English speaking characters and now I can locate a text file in the terminal to be read.\nedge-playback --voice en-US-AriaNeural --file \u0026#34;tts.txt\u0026#34; This command would read aloud the entire text file with subtitles output in the terminal, very cool.\nedge-tts --voice en-US-AriaNeural --file \u0026#34;tts.txt\u0026#34; --write-media \u0026#34;tts.mp3\u0026#34; This command would generate a mp3 file from the text file.\nI tried to make offline audiobook by this and found out it would run into a connection issue if the text is too long. This might be an API protection mechanism against abuse.\nThus, when I need to make a long book, I have to separate it into pieces and consolidate them by using ffmpeg.\nffmpeg -i \u0026#34;concat:part1.mp3|part2.mp3\u0026#34; -c copy output.mp3 or\n(for %i in (*.mp3) do @echo file \u0026#39;%i\u0026#39;) \u0026gt; mylist.txt ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp3 Either would work depending how many files I want to merge.\nI have tried different GUI tools and none of those works reliably. This is by far the most reliable yet easy way if you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with the command-line.\nGrapheneOS Because GrapheneOS doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide any TTS engine by default. I use Feeder regularly for RSS and sometimes I want to listen instead of read. This tool brings Edge TTS into Android which is very cool.\nIt compromises some privacy by using TTS engines. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s not something out-of-the-box for a hardened Android build. This is a trade-off and I\u0026rsquo;d rather use Edge TTS than Google\u0026rsquo;s.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/edgetts/","summary":"Back to the Command-line For some reason, MS Edge for Linux does not have the Read Aloud feature which is the only reason I would like to use Edge.

That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m kind of picky on computer mouses and being paranoid of acceleration in the OS.\nPermanently disabling acceleration for Windows is simple. Besides unchecking the \u0026ldquo;Enhance pointer precision\u0026rdquo; in the main.cpl, some registry hacks such as the good old classic \u0026ldquo;CPL Mouse Fix\u0026rdquo; or the later \u0026ldquo;MarkC\u0026rdquo; would do it easily by a REG/batch file. It is also possible doing manually if you want.\nHowever, this is much harder for Linux.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t express more that how much I rely on ArchWiki when tweaking any Linux-based system. By following the wiki page, I can temporarily accomplish the result but failed autostarting 50-mouse-acceleration.conf to preserve the result after rebooting.\njagardaniel is my savior by sharing this script on reddit. My only change is the device name (find it by xinput --list) and Accel Speed:\n#!/bin/sh device=\u0026#34;my mouse\u0026#34; if xinput list --id-only \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1; then xinput --set-prop \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;libinput Accel Profile Enabled\u0026#39; 0, 1 xinput --set-prop \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;libinput Accel Speed\u0026#39; 0 notify-send \u0026#34;Mouse settings applied\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;Unable to find device ${device}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit 1 fi After saving it, run chmod +x script.sh from terminal to ensure its permission and add it into Startup Applications Preferences. This works perfectly.\nTrackball This method of autostarting script also works with my Kensington trackball thanks for ArtiomSu creating this fantastic script. It enables natural scrolling and disables acceleration.

Therefore, one universal gesture tool that runs at desktop/system level is necessary. For Windows, there are many choices and I use StrokesPlus.\nHowever, for Linux, it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to find any alternative.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried easystroke which is no longer maintained for many years. It works very well and has all the functions I needed. Unfortunately, there is one problem ruined everything. It crashes randomly and kills the Xorg/X11 server. That results rebooting of the desktop environment and send me back to the log-in window while force quitting all running processes.\nThis can be disastrous while working and it happens so randomly that is very difficult to troubleshoot with.\nI had to fall back to browser extensions and set them up one by one. There are two open source options, Gesturefy for Firefox-based, smartUp for Chromium-based and no love for Webkit. They are great compare to other extensions and by design there is NO extensions that work with loading page and internal pages. So I have to keep pressing Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab when I have to.\nMaybe I can find/create something better in the future.\nTrackPoint There are also problems with Windows undoubtedly. The TrackPoint on my old ThinkPad is a big one, especially with newer versions of Windows 10. Although I can make it work perfectly by sneak the outdated Synaptics and UltraNav into the newer OS, the process is tedious and painful.\nI also use portable USB keyboards with TrackPoint so a light and portable solution is needed. My requirement is simple, just to make the TrackPoint behave like under most Linux desktop:\n Move to scroll while holding down the middle button Perform middle click as a mouse wheel  An AutoHotkey script works great and easy to set up.\nFirst, install the latest AHK 1.x from its release page\nThen, download the script and simply run it to try and tweak.

[{"content":"Back to the Command-line For some reason, MS Edge for Linux does not have the Read Aloud feature which is the only reason I would like to use Edge. The TTS engine made by Microsoft sounds incomparable to those poorly made chrome extensions.\nTherefore, I found a work around with edge-tts. This is a CLI tool uses Edge TTS service. The instruction on its Github repo is very good.\nAfter installation, use edge-tts --list-voices | grep US to show English speaking characters and now I can locate a text file in the terminal to be read.\nedge-playback --voice en-US-AriaNeural --file \u0026#34;tts.txt\u0026#34; This command would read aloud the entire text file with subtitles output in the terminal, very cool.\nedge-tts --voice en-US-AriaNeural --file \u0026#34;tts.txt\u0026#34; --write-media \u0026#34;tts.mp3\u0026#34; This command would generate a mp3 file from the text file.\nI tried to make offline audiobook by this and found out it would run into a connection issue if the text is too long. This might be an API protection mechanism against abuse.\nThus, when I need to make a long book, I have to separate it into pieces and consolidate them by using ffmpeg.\nffmpeg -i \u0026#34;concat:part1.mp3|part2.mp3\u0026#34; -c copy output.mp3 or\n(for %i in (*.mp3) do @echo file \u0026#39;%i\u0026#39;) \u0026gt; mylist.txt ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp3 Either would work depending how many files I want to merge.\nI have tried different GUI tools and none of those works reliably. This is by far the most reliable yet easy way if you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with the command-line.\nGrapheneOS Because GrapheneOS doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide any TTS engine by default. I use Feeder regularly for RSS and sometimes I want to listen instead of read. This tool brings Edge TTS into Android which is very cool.\nIt compromises some privacy by using TTS engines. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s not something out-of-the-box for a hardened Android build. This is a trade-off and I\u0026rsquo;d rather use Edge TTS than Google\u0026rsquo;s.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/edgetts/","summary":"Back to the Command-line For some reason, MS Edge for Linux does not have the Read Aloud feature which is the only reason I would like to use Edge.

That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m kind of picky on computer mouses and being paranoid of acceleration in the OS.\nPermanently disabling acceleration for Windows is simple.

This works perfectly.\nTrackball This method of autostarting script also works with my Kensington trackball thanks for ArtiomSu creating this fantastic script.

Therefore, one universal gesture tool that runs at desktop/system level is necessary. For Windows, there are many choices and I use StrokesPlus.\nHowever, for Linux, it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to find any alternative.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried easystroke which is no longer maintained for many years. It works very well and has all the functions I needed. Unfortunately, there is one problem ruined everything. It crashes randomly and kills the Xorg/X11 server. That results rebooting of the desktop environment and send me back to the log-in window while force quitting all running processes.\nThis can be disastrous while working and it happens so randomly that is very difficult to troubleshoot with.\nI had to fall back to browser extensions and set them up one by one. There are two open source options, Gesturefy for Firefox-based, smartUp for Chromium-based and no love for Webkit. They are great compare to other extensions and by design there is NO extensions that work with loading page and internal pages. So I have to keep pressing Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab when I have to.\nMaybe I can find/create something better in the future.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/tweakingmouse/","summary":"Acceleration During my teenage years, I was really into FPS and RTS games.

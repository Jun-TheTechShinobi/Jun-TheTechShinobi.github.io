That was the beginning of my Internet journey and tweaking CSS code while posting an article was fun.\nToday, I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to post my stuff on somewhere like mastodon or telegram channel but here I am. Because I feel most comfortable this way.\nDilemma of Giving Back The beginning of my Linux journey was with some early version of OpenWrt and BackTrack, then Puppy and Ubuntu. At this very moment, I\u0026rsquo;m typing with MarkText on a Pop!_OS and all my servers are running on either CentOS or Debian.\nHowever, it was a shame that I have never contribute a single line of code back to the FOSS community at all.

The notes might be helpful for someone so I think they are worth to share.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/why-i-started/","summary":"In This Day and Age?

[{"content":"A Deep Dive into Voice Cloning with SoftVC VITS and Bert-VITS2 In the previous post, I have tried a little bit of TTS Generation WebUI and found it\u0026rsquo;s interesting. So, I decide to train a usable model with my own voice.\nThis voice cloning project explores both SVC for Voice Changing and VITS for Text-to-Speech. There is no one tool does all jobs.\nI have tested several tools for this project. Many of the good guides, like this, this and this, are in Chinese. So, I thought it\u0026rsquo;s useful to post my notes in English.\nAlthough so-vits-svc has been archived for a few months, probably due to oppression, it is still the tool for the best result.\nOther related tools such as so-vits-svc-fork, so-vits-svc-5.0, DDSP-SVC, and RVC provide either faster/liter optimization, more features or better interfaces.\nBut with enough time and resources, none of these alternatives can compete with the superior result generated by the original so-vits-svc.\nFor TTS, a new tool called Bert-VITS2 works fantastically and has already matured with its final release last month. It has some very different use case, for example, audio content creation.\nPrepare Dataset The audio files of the dataset should be WAV format, 44100 Hz, 16bit, mono, 1-2 hours ideally.\nExtract from a Song Ultimate Vocal Remover is the easiest tool for this job. There is a thread explains everything in details.\nUVR Workflows  Remove and extract Instrumental  Model: VR - UVR(4_HP-Vocal-UVR) Settings: 512 - 10 - GPU Output Instrumental and unclean vocal   Remove and extract background vocal  Model: VR - UVR(5_HP-Karaoke-UVR) Settings: 512 - 10 - GPU Output background vocal and unclean main vocal   Remove reverb and noise  Model: VR - UVR-DeEcho-DeReverb \u0026amp; UVR-DeNoise Settings: 512 - 10 - GPU - No Other Only Output clean main vocal   (Optional) Using RipX (non-free) to perform a manual fine cleaning  Preparation for vocal recording It\u0026rsquo;s better to record in a treated room with condenser microphone, otherwise use a directional or dynamic microphone to reduce noise.\nCheapskate\u0026rsquo;s Audio Equipment The very first time I\u0026rsquo;ve got into music was during my high school, with the blue Sennheiser MX500 and Koss Porta Pro. I still remember the first time I was recording a song that was on a Sony VAIO with Cool Edit Pro.\nNowadays, I still resist to spend a lot of money on audio hardware as an amateur because it is literally a money-sucking blackhole.\nNonetheless, I really appreciate the reliability of those cheap production equipment.\nThe core part of my setup is a Behringer UCA202 and it\u0026rsquo;s perfect for my use cases. I bought it for $10 while a price drop.\nIt is so called \u0026ldquo;Audio Interface\u0026rdquo; but basically just a sound card with multiple ports. I used RCA to 3.5mm TRS cables for my headphones, a semi-open K240s for regular output and a closed-back HD669/MDR7506 for monitor output.\nAll three mentioned headphones are under $100 for normal price. And there are clones from Samson, Tascam, Knox Gear and more out there for less than $50.\nFor the input device, I\u0026rsquo;m using a dynamic microphone for the sake of my environmental noises. It is a SM58 copy (Pyle) + a Tascam DR-05 recorder (as amplifier). Other clones such as SL84c or wm58 would do it too.\nI use a XLR to 3.5mm TRS cable to connect the microphone to the MIC/External-input of the recorder, and then use an AUX cable to connect between the line-out of the recorder and the input of the UCA202.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not recommend to buy an \u0026ldquo;audio interface\u0026rdquo; and a dedicated amplifier to replicate my setup. A $10 c-media USB sound card should be good enough. The Syba model that I owned is capable to \u0026ldquo;pre-amp\u0026rdquo; dynamic microphones directly and even some lower-end phantom powered microphones.\nThe setup can go extremely cheap ($40~60) but with UCA202 and DR-05, the sound is much cleaner. And I really like the physical controls, versatility and portability of my old good digital recorder.\nAudacity workflows Although when I was getting paid as a designer, I was pretty happy with Audition. But for personal use on a fun project, Audacity is the way to avoid the chaotic evil of Adobe.\n Noise Reduction Dereverb Truncate Silence Normalize  audio-slicer Use audio-slicer or audio-slicer (gui) to slice the audio file into small pieces for later use.\nDefault setting works great.\nCleaning dataset Remove those very short ones and re-slice which are still over 10 seconds.\nIn case of large dataset, remove all that are less than 4 sec. In case of small dataset, remove only under 2 sec.\nIf necessary, perform manual inspection for every single file.\nMatch loudness Use Audacity again with Loudness Normalization, 0db should do it.\nso-vits-svc Set up environment Virtual environment is essential to run multiple python tools inside one system. I used to use VMs and Docker, but now I found anaconda is way quicker, handier than the others.\nCreate a new environment for so-vits-svc and activate it\nconda create -n so-vits-svc python=3.8 conda activate so-vits-svc Then install requirements\ngit clone https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc cd so-vits-svc pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 #for linux pip install -r requirements.txt #for windows pip install -r requirements_win.txt pip install --upgrade fastapi==0.84.0 pip install --upgrade gradio==3.41.2 pip install --upgrade pydantic==1.10.12 pip install fastapi uvicorn Initialization Download pretrained models  pretrain  wget https://huggingface.co/WitchHuntTV/checkpoint_best_legacy_500.pt/resolve/main/checkpoint_best_legacy_500.pt wget https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/resolve/main/rmvpe.pt   logs/44k  wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/ms903/sovits4.0-768vec-layer12/resolve/main/sovits_768l12_pre_large_320k/clean_D_320000.pth wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/ms903/sovits4.0-768vec-layer12/resolve/main/sovits_768l12_pre_large_320k/clean_G_320000.pth   logs/44k/diffusion  wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/ms903/Diff-SVC-refactor-pre-trained-model/resolve/main/fix_pitch_add_vctk_600k/model_0.pt (Alternative) wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/ms903/DDSP-SVC-4.0/resolve/main/pre-trained-model/model_0.pt (Alternative) wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/ms903/Diff-SVC-refactor-pre-trained-model/blob/main/hubertsoft_fix_pitch_add_vctk_500k/model_0.pt   pretrain/nsf_hifigan  wget -P pretrain/ https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/download/nsf-hifigan-v1/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip unzip -od pretrain/nsf_hifigan pretrain/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip    Dataset Preparation Put all Prepared audio.wav files into dataset_raw/character\ncd so-vits-svc python resample.py --skip_loudnorm python preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12 --vol_aug python preprocess_hubert_f0.py --use_diff Edit Configs The file is located at configs/config.json\nlog interval : the frequency of printing log eval interval : the frequency of saving checkpoints epochs : total steps keep ckpts : numbers of saved checkpoints, 0 for unlimited. half_type : fp32 in my case batch_size : the smaller the faster (rougher), the larger the slower (better).

Recommend RMVPE when using.\nPitch change is useful when singing a feminine song using a model with masculine voice, or vice versa.\nClustering model/feature retrieval mixing ratio is the way of controlling the tone. Use 0.1 to get clearest speech, and use 0.9 to get the closest tone to the model.\nshallow diffusion steps should be set around 50, it enhances the result at 30-100 steps.\nAudio Editing This procedure is optional. Just for production of a better song.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go into details in this since the audio editing software, or so called DAW (digital audio workstation), that I\u0026rsquo;m using are non-free. I have no intention to advocate proprietary software even though the entire industry is paywalled and closed-source.\nAudacity supports multitrack, effects and a lot more. It does load some advanced VST plugins as well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find tutorials on mastering songs with Audacity.\nTypically, the mastering process should be mixing/balancing, EQ/compressing, reverb, imaging. The more advanced the tool is, the easier the process will be.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll definitely spend more time on adopting Audacity for my mastering process in the future and I recommend everyone do so.\nso-vits-svc-fork This is a so-vits-svc fork with realtime support and the models are compatible.

My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.\nBack in the days, I used to repair people\u0026rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it. Then, I bought a cheap E3-1245 and GTX 750 Ti to make it a gaming rig. I played a lot of games on that, such as Dark Souls series and Metro series. Before it was sold, last games I played on this build was Metro Exodus and Elden Ring.\nSandy Bridge was the last generation using soldered integrated heat spreader (IHS) in a long time. It\u0026rsquo;s cooler and stays cool over time way better than its thermal-pasted successors (e.g. Haswell/Hotwell). Back then, there was a doggerel joking about AMD\u0026rsquo;s performance and Intel\u0026rsquo;s temperature, saying \u0026ldquo;Unlocking AMD, Delidding Intel.\u0026rdquo;\nThe real fun project was a LGA771 to LGA775 Mod on a Dell Vostro 220s. It was a hardware hack that letting this low-end Vostro uses a dirt cheap yet powerful Xeon. The motherboard also has 4 SATA ports so it works well as a NAS.\nNext is our today\u0026rsquo;s topic, Dell Optiplex 3010 SFF. It was on sell for quite a few months but seemingly no one wants it at all. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a completely garbage comparing the Vostro above. It came with an i3-3220 but has been upgraded to the i5-2300 that was replaced from the gaming rig for the sake of LGA 1155. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to put an Xeon E3 on it but a weird graphic card without output port.\nPhilosophy If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering—why bother spending such amount of time and effort tinkering those e-wastes? Just because of being a cheapskate and saving money?\nHere is the answer from my previous post:\n I really like the idea from cheapskatesguide and lowtechmagazine that could save people from the pitfalls of consumerism. Moreover, to me it\u0026rsquo;s not about saving money on technology nor adapting certain lifestyles. This is a manifestation of ideology, the way of pursuing freedom.\n By this chance, I would like to add more details on that.\n On the internet, proprietary software isn’t the only way to lose your freedom. Service as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS, is another way to let someone else have power over your computing.\nIf you use SaaSS, the server operator controls your computing. It requires entrusting all the pertinent data to the server operator, which will be forced to show it to the state as well—who does that server really serve, after all?\nSaaSS does not require covert code to obtain the user’s data. Instead, users must send their data to the server in order to use it. This has the same effect as spyware: the server operator gets the data—with no special effort, by the nature of SaaSS.\nWith SaaSS, the server operator can change the software in use on the server. He ought to be able to do this, since it’s his computer; but the result is the same as using a proprietary application program with a universal back door: someone has the power to silently impose changes in how the user’s computing gets done.\nThus, SaaSS is equivalent to running proprietary software with spyware and a universal back door. It gives the server operator unjust power over the user, and that power is something we must resist.\nSaaSS always subjects you to the power of the server operator, and the only remedy is, Don’t use SaaSS! Don’t use someone else’s server to do your own computing on data provided by you.\n These are selected from Free Software, Free Society and I recommend to read the whole book if you have not already.\nRMS was right, once again. SaaS is dangerous to human liberty and I was aware of it. Since it was called \u0026ldquo;the cloud\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;ve been self-hosting and peer-to-peer everything back that time.\nNowadays, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;Generative AI\u0026rdquo;. This is why the first chapter of my Stable Diffusion article called \u0026ldquo;No DALL-E, No Midjourney and No Colab\u0026rdquo; where talks about neutrality and transparency. AIaaS leaks data and not secure. Not only ChatGPT can become BadGPT, but also open-source LLM can become PoisonGPT. Just like Diffusion models can have malware. Never blindly trust something just because it\u0026rsquo;s open-source.\nHardware Note: This is rather a rough record than a proper guide. Keep in mind, be sure you have enough experience tinkering PC hardware. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.\nDuring the summer, I was working on my research paper and now I have some time back to this fun project.\nAlthough I had some fun and had done quite some projects with it, the biggest con about My mini Server is the VRAM capacity. 4GB is too limiting when I attempt to do training, like LoRA models. Not only that, even using ControlNet or running Open LLM are too restrained. So I decide to buy a NVIDIA Tesla M40, with 24 GB of VRAM which is the largest amount I can get from a cheap single card.\nMoney on the parts ($180-250 in total) :\n Dell Optiplex (Sandy Bridge), $0  In my case it\u0026rsquo;s 3010 SFF but other models (7010/9010) would be better On Ebay $40 for whole unit, $20 for motherboard only These models apears in surplus or thrift store quite often With the BIOS hack, neither Above 4G Decoding, Resizable BAR nor pci=realloc are needed   NVIDIA Tesla M40 24 GB, $110 Corsair AIO Cooler, $25  It\u0026rsquo;s the cheapest I can find, unknown model The condition is working but looks pretty much AS-IS I refilled it with purified water, checked the seal and pressure tested the pump No mounting bracket and I don\u0026rsquo;t need it either The screw holes on M40 is 58 x 58 mm, the smaller cooler surface the better (need space to put small heatsinks on VRAM chips) A $17 NZXT Kraken G12 is the proper way to go, but those compatible coolers can be expensive even buying used Most CPU AIO coolers would do it though, if using zip tie method Regular CPU air coolers may be too heavy for our card, and the blower fan adapter method is loud, ineffecient yet not cheap   Seasonic SSR-550RM, $28  Just a little bit overkill but it\u0026rsquo;s a good deal   CPU 8 Pin EPS Cable for Seasonic Modular PSU, $10 Dual PSU Adapter, $9  Optional, bought it for convenience   1TB SATA SSD, $0  Optional, possible to hack in NVMe drives for larger form like 7010/9010    GPU Selection Depending on price, availability and capacity, only K80, M40 and P40 are in my options.\n7xx(Kepler)：Tesla K80 24G 9xx(Maxwell)：Tesla M40 12G/24G，Tesla M4 4G 10x0(Pascal)：Tesla P100 16G，Tesla P40 24G，Tesla P4 8G 20x0(Volta/Turing)：Tesla T4 16G，Tesla V100 16G/32G 30x0(Ampere)：NVIDIA A100 40/80GB，NVIDIA A40 48GB，NVIDIA RTX A6000 48G The best bang for the budget seems like the old good K80, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t. The driver for Kepler cards are stucked with 440.95.01 and CUDA Toolkit 11.4. Besides that, K80 24G version is actually two 12G versions so it may only recognize half of the VRAM in some application.\nThe problem with Pascal card is that costs more money but not worth it. The support of quantization matters when it comes to AI inference. However, in order to get the performance gain from utilizing quantization. We are not only need to have the supported hardware and use the correct model, but the software needs to support it as well. Eventhough P100 supports FP16 and P40 supports INT8, they are not well supported by the upstream.\nTherefore, if using INT8 or FP16 is not expected, because most of the time it runs with FP32, no reason to spend more on P100 and P40. M40 is the sweet spot without doubt, and it saves a lot of hassle on optimazation. All in all, M40 is great for non-production evironment where performance isn\u0026rsquo;t the priority.\nAbout Power Supply Because there is only a 4+4 pin CPU power cable on my 550w PSU and Tesla cards require CPU\u0026rsquo;s EPS connection. I bought a $7 spliting PCIe to EPS adapter. Sadly, it melt within minutes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very likely that the melting was caused by the copper in the cable was too thin or the resistance of the cable was too high. To power the 250w GPU, a thicker stronger cable is required.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to force the 4+4 pin male connector fit into the 8 pin female socket on the GPU by filing it, but didn\u0026rsquo;t try. Finally, I bought a dedicated modular cable instead of another adapter. It says \u0026ldquo;UL1007 18AWG tinned copper wire with high current terminal\u0026rdquo; that sounds strong enough for the task and it indeed does.\nThe dual PSU adapter is more convenient than a switch jumper cable and safer than a paper clip.\nThermal MOD (Zip-tie Method) When hardware is incompatible, zip tie is our best friend.\nI have talked a lot on the cooling system already. Here just a showcase for my zip tie method mounting any sized AIO cooler, case fan and heat sink.\nIt is quite stable and low-noise. Works on both CPU and GPU. As a bounus, the zip ties also hold up the GPU backplate quite well, and the water pipes can support the GPU to balance its weight if tweaked to a good angle. So, nothing will come loose or bend in a long run.\nIn my CASE, the cardboard box, the cooling is a bit overkill and I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy about 23-26C idle and 46-52C full-load temperature.\nVery cool temperature on idle:\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 535.104.05 Driver Version: 535.104.05 CUDA Version: 12.2 | |-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M | Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

It is actually MECLR1 on my board (right side of the photo).\nAfter updated my BIOS version from A09 to A20, I made a backup using fptw64.exe -d backup.bin.\nNext, follow this DSDT guide but during step 5, after finishing the changes, add some more extra changes from this issue:\n Change If (((MM64 == Zero) || (OSYS \u0026lt;= 0x07D3))) to If (((OSYS \u0026lt;= 0x07D3))) Change ElseIf (E4GM) to Else Remove this section   Else { CreateDWordField (BUF0, \\_SB.PCI0._Y0F._LEN, M4LN) // _LEN: Length M4LN = Zero } Continue rest of the steps to finish the DSDT mod, then proceed with UEFI Patch guide to get the patched version of the mod rom.\nFinally, use fptw64.exe -bios -f modpatched.bin to flash the rom.\nFiles I have share all files generated during the process in this repo.\nA20MOD.rom.patched.bin is the binary file named modpatched.bin in the final step above.

My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.\nBack in the days, I used to repair people\u0026rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it.

Last time I had encountered this sort of situation was over a decade ago with TrueCrypt on an external HDD and unfortunately lost everything that weren\u0026rsquo;t backed up. I\u0026rsquo;ve recovered everything from backup this time so I decide to document it.\nThe entire storage on my daily driver is encrypted with LUKS and it suddenly fails on boot decryption. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the header backed up and have stopped using Timeshift for a long time due to it\u0026rsquo;s unschedulable which lead to chaotic performance impact.\nI believe it\u0026rsquo;s due to physical data corruption on the LUKS header area. The hardware is a very aged low-end TLC NVMe drive (Toshiba BG3) that pulled out of someone\u0026rsquo;s dead laptop. I bought a new replacement by the chance of current SSD price drop. I got a Samsung 970 EVO Plus (1TB) for the same price as my SK hynix Gold S31 (1TB) bought on Black Friday, and it\u0026rsquo;s NVME instead of SATA.\nI do not like to consume on electronics especially buying brand new but sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s literally cheaper than buying used ones. Getting \u0026ldquo;perishable hardware\u0026rdquo; such as SSDs in new condition is more forgiving to me when considering lifespan and reliability factors like TBW and MTBF.\nFortunately, I have the full system backed up within days so I\u0026rsquo;m safe netted against a critical data loss.\nMy backup is made with my favorite tool restic locally:\nrestic --exclude={/dev,/media,/mnt,/proc,/run,/sys,/tmp,/var/tmp} -r /path/to/repository/ backup / Recovery Steps Prepare the New Disk Usually, manual partitioning the new disk, mounting it and then restoring the backup is the way to go. However, with encryption and EFI can make things way more complex. So, I just did a fresh install using a Live CD of the same distro and install restic while the installation.\nRestore the Backup After installation, restore right in the live system:\nrestic --exclude={/boot,/etc/fstab,/etc/crypttab} -r /path/to/repository restore latest -t /new/disk/root/ The exclude will avoid interference of both boot and encryption.\nCover Up Usually, this step involves repairing/rebuilding grub2 and fstab, but that is not the case here.\nAfter rebooting to the restored system on the new disk, the graphics crashed. This results in unable to switch into TTY by CTRL+ALT+F1-12 keys.\nI think it is caused by file corruption occurs around my graphic related files, perhaps driver files.\nSolution:\n Reboot to the Grub menu, press \u0026quot;e\u0026quot; to edit boot options Remove quiet and add 3 in the end Press Ctrl+X to boot into the system without crashing the graphic driver Switch to TTY and reinstall the corrupted driver, in my case remove mesa-dri-drivers and install mesa-dri-drivers  I believe excluding/usr/lib64/dri during the restore process may prevent it but it won\u0026rsquo;t happen again.\nI still need to repair my network drive in fstab and that is it.

Thanks for Daniela Baron\u0026rsquo;s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.\nHey everyone. Well, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if anyone is interested in that direction, but I digressed, let\u0026rsquo;s get to start.\nThis beautiful artwork is generated by me, using an AI tool called Stable Diffusion, with these generation info. Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if any of you have been got your hands on it, or been using something similar like Midjourney, but it\u0026rsquo;s stunningly amazing.\nWhat you see here is a a humanoid AI robot from Dystopian future, standing face-to-face with a wasteland scavenging survivor from post-apocalyptic future. What I\u0026rsquo;m trying to express here is that, although they are confronting each other, but they really have no clue whether the other is a friend or foe.\nWhy, you may ask? Because one thing they both are pretty damn sure about is, the great catastrophe either already happened or is about to happen, is caused by human.\nAnyway, let\u0026rsquo;s put that thought on hold for now and get to the main topic of our today\u0026rsquo;s lecture - AI and cyber security, also some philosophy thinking.\nInsead of introducing myself in a old fasion, does anyone know what Shinobi means? It also relates to our topic. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it in the end.\nReconnaissance Introduction of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) So, I\u0026rsquo;ve been informed that this course is about reconnaissance. Now, to be honest, this term has always reminded me of the military more than anything else. Although the infosec industry has been heavily influenced by the presence of prior military personnel and government agencies, at the end of the day, it still falls under the umbrella of the IT industry.\nNow, back in the day when I was learning ethical hacking like a decade ago, it was called Footprinting. It involved a variety of techniques such as port scanning, network mapping, and intel collection.\nBack in the old days, there was no social media around. You can\u0026rsquo;t just go online and Google it or check on your collection of leaked datasets. But let me tell you, if you wanted to collect information on someone, you had to go dumpster diving. Yes, you heard that right. Teachers and textbooks would tell you, literally, to collect intel in the trash cans. And believe it or not, it is still effective today. But we just don\u0026rsquo;t have to do that anymore. Because we have better ways now.\nWhat we have now is Open-Source Intelligence, or OSINT for short. And trust me, this technique is the way to go. If you want to learn more about it, there\u0026rsquo;s a link down below that will provide you the full version of the lecture.\nSources for OSINT Here\u0026rsquo;re some common sources that you can tap into.\nNeeds for OSINT Let\u0026rsquo;s look at who might need to conduct OSINT operations.\nStages of the Intelligence Cycle Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the five stages of the Intelligence Cycle. These stages are pretty self-explanatory and should be easy to understand. You may come across some variations of this, but they should all look pretty similar.\nPassive vs Active OSINT Next, we have passive versus active. As you may already know, this is the fundamental concept when you collecting information for your attack or pentesting. No matter in the cyberspace or physical world, this concept should remains the same.\nAI-OSINT Now, here\u0026rsquo;s the AI kicks in. You can use tools like ChatGPT to generate a perfect profile for your Alias account, and it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to identify it\u0026rsquo;s a fake person.\nYou can even create video and audio contents using Synthesia or D-ID to make it even more convincing. This is a powerful tool for social engineering attacks, and it\u0026rsquo;s important to be aware of these techniques.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re like me, living far away from your family, it\u0026rsquo;s important to prepare some secret words with them, in case they are targeted by someone using AI with your voice or video. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to protect yourself and your loved ones from these types of attacks, especially if they\u0026rsquo;re not as tech-savvy as you are.\nIt can also be used to bypass security check or generating disinformation as a countermeasure to protect something you can\u0026rsquo;t simply remove from the public.\nMore Use cases Here are some tips for AI-OSINT. PimEyes is a popular option to find more photos of someone by reverse searching just like tineye. However, we also need to verify that the information we find belongs to a real person. With the increasing capability of AI, this can be difficult.\nChatGPT is still locked without internet access but it will be able to do that sooner or later. In the meantime, tools like GPT4 or the microsoft alternative can be used for AI-OSINT with extra layers of protection from regulations. But this window won\u0026rsquo;t be long, and please be a decent person, do things legally. You will get caught if your countersurveillance skill is not better than your offensive skills.\nEven if you\u0026rsquo;re doing white hat gigs for helping some entity to do pentesting or bug bounty, and you think you are completely legal and moral and you\u0026rsquo;re doing the right thing. You can still get into troubles because others don\u0026rsquo;t think so, and the law doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily work for good people with the best intentions. Unfortunately, sometimes, it can be the opposite.\nOkay, back to the topic, ChatGPT writes really good script code in python and powershell. The explanation and commenting for the code is god like, so if you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner, go try it out if you have not already.\nMore tools Here are some more tools if you would like to further exploring OSINT.\nSpiderFoot is an incredibly versatile OSINT toolkit, and you can find more tools like that in these two links.\nThe SANS OSINT Summit is an annual event hosted by the SANS Institute, and they\u0026rsquo;re currently accepting applications for this year. So if you\u0026rsquo;re into OSINT, don\u0026rsquo;t miss it.\nFor those more interested in privacy and cyber hygiene rather than proactive OSINT, there are a couple of sites that you might want to check out. These two sites are great to have. Both of them are relatively late comers but they\u0026rsquo;re more focused on helping average people rather than tech savvy ones. The OSINT show and techlore can teach you everything from choosing the right web browser, instant messenger, VPN, and email provider, to operating systems and private phone ROMs. They offer videos, podcasts, books, and community forums for you to engage with.\nNow, If online privacy and anonymity is not your thing, then check out this document from NSA, yes, you heard it right, it\u0026rsquo;s from the NSA ! And surprisingly, they\u0026rsquo;re really teaching you how to secure your home network and it\u0026rsquo;s very comprehensive. So, give it a shot if you think there are too many smart/backdoored IoT devices in your home that can invite attackers to outsmart you.\nIntroduction of ChatGPT Alright, now we\u0026rsquo;re getting to the hot topic. Unless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard of it by now. So I won\u0026rsquo;t waste your time by repeating something you can easily find online or get answered by ChatGPT itself.\nUse cases Basically, these are what you can do with ChatGPT for now.\nDepends on whether you\u0026rsquo;re on the Blue team or the Red team, you can either find vulnerabilities or do threat hunting with it, Write Exploits or Patches, create Malware code or Incident response plan, generate phishing emails or filtering rules, and deliver payload or get alert from logs.\nThese are nothing new to the cybersec industry. Many SaaS products on the market have already implemented machine learning features for years. The new AI language model may not be as robust as the those solutions, but it can do much more. Or it\u0026rsquo;s more like a so-called general AI, which is more versatile than the older ones. Therefore, the new AI does not replace the old ML systems but rather enhances and integrates them.\nMore use cases If I have a whole semester to teach this lecture, I would like to login and show you some prompt engineering right now. Unfortunately, not today. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve compiled a list of links to some excellent video lectures on that. These lectures cover use case examples for prompt engineering and also discuss the ethics of it.\nFor those interested in the architecture and training of AI models, the first video goes into detail on those topics.\nThe fourth video focuses on creating SOPs(standard operating procedures) for IRTs(incident response teams), which can be quite challenging to manage. ChatGPT can greatly assist with it.\nIn the fifth video, they create logic apps for threat intelligence using a CSV fine-tune training file. This is a more advanced use case than the others.\nThe last video covers creating phishing emails, polymorphic malware, and pentesting with Nmap automating scripts. They also discuss human-machine intelligence, which combines people, processes, and AI, and how to train a good model.\nRisks If you\u0026rsquo;re already in the cybersecurity field, then you\u0026rsquo;re probably aware of the saying:\n \u0026ldquo;There is no silver bullet.\u0026rdquo;\n But in the real world, it\u0026rsquo;s even more complex than that and I\u0026rsquo;d like to add onto that:\n \u0026ldquo;There is not only no silver bullet, but also everything is a double-edged sword.\u0026rdquo;\n This idea is actually came from Sigmund Freud, he said:\n \u0026ldquo;If a knife does not cut, it cannot be used for healing either.\u0026rdquo;\n For those who does not familiar with psychoanalysis —it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much like what we do in cybersecurity.\nIn the first link, the word OPWNAI is pretty funny that made by some genius from checkpoint research. And I also did my own investigation on how ChatGPT can be abused by black hat in the second link.\nAt the bottom, I put a link to alert people who still trust in OpenAI blindly. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into that further.\nOpenAI\u0026rsquo;s data breach As many of you may already know, there was a data breach of OpenAI recently. And let me tell you, the way they respond to the public is absolutely unacceptable for the open source community and that reveals what the company really is.\nEven if you don\u0026rsquo;t care about how AI will impact our future, it\u0026rsquo;s still worth to watch this video just for fun. It\u0026rsquo;s only about 3 minutes: How ChatGPT lied like hell to Professor Doug White about OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s recent data breach.\nAt the bottom of the page, we have two comments from Open Source Security Podcast and me.\nIn the podcast, they said:\n \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid of ChatGPT. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of OpenIA.\u0026rdquo;\n In my blog post, I emphasized that:\n \u0026ldquo;AI itself is not a threat, but the capital behind it.\u0026rdquo;\n The technology is only as good or bad as the people behind it, and the motivations driving them. Go listen or read the whole thing if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in.\nDeep-dive into Thinking Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s relax and have some fun. Can anyone recognize these gang of four in this image?\nFrom the left, where is Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud. You may be curious why the hell these four gansters came together. Let\u0026rsquo;s find that out.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re getting into some heavy philosophical territory.\nThe death of the subject is a pretty depressing idea that basically says that our free will is nihilated or nullified by external factors like social culture, the language we speak, and our past experiences. In other words, we\u0026rsquo;re not as unique as we thought we were.\nPosthumanism takes a step further by denying the special status of Homo sapiens and accepting that AI could be the successor of humanity. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s right, the robots will bring our civilization into the next level and the historical responsibility of Homo sapiens is sadly going to the end.\nTranshumanism is just the philosophy term for cyborg, it\u0026rsquo;s the transition period before posthumanism. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already got a RFID chip implanted under your skin, congratulations, you\u0026rsquo;re on your way to becoming a cyborg. And Singularity is usually considered as the point of AGI or strong AI come out.\nSo there you have it. Some heavy stuff huh? Let\u0026rsquo;s see how people talking about it.\nMore Thinking Alright everyone, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many of you are already deep into this train of thought or if you\u0026rsquo;re completely against it, but I\u0026rsquo;ve got some links to a few lectures of art, education, society, and more.\nNow, there\u0026rsquo;s a quote I came across from Plastic Pills that I think is worth pondering on:\n \u0026ldquo;Socrates tells a myth that before his time, the technology of writing is something that needs to be rejected. Because the technology of writing is going to destroy Humanity. Paradoxically, perhaps our definition of humanity today that it\u0026rsquo;s about to be destroyed is literacy.\u0026rdquo;\n I\u0026rsquo;m not saying to support on any side, but I do think there are more crucial issues that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t ignore.\nArendt and Heidegger Listen up. Let\u0026rsquo;s face it, the dangers of technology. As Hannah Arendt said in her book, The Life of the Mind:\n \u0026ldquo;The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.\u0026rdquo;\n According to Martin Heidegger as well:\n \u0026ldquo;The danger of technology does not lie in technology itself. The essence of technology is by no means anything technological.\u0026rdquo;\n Another quote from his book, The Question Concerning Technology, where he said:\n \u0026ldquo;Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it.\nBut we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly pay homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.\u0026rdquo;\n Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget the historical context of Heidegger\u0026rsquo;s words. He wrote them in the aftermath of World War II, which saw the horrors of gas chambers and atomic bombs.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s world is not far from the great catastrophe in each direction. So, it\u0026rsquo;s important not to tunnel vision on AI itself, but use the technology as a tool of revealing, to uncover what was hidden and concealed.\nThe real threat Here is a great documentary and some comedy shows you can learn from. Surveillance capitalism is already there, behind the scene and stealing freedom and democracy from every single one of us. This is not a conspiracy theory at all, otherwise Edward Snowden shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in Russia.\nTeaser for Reading Books If you\u0026rsquo;re a book reader or wanna become one. Try watch these videos and pick up some books mentioned.\nChomsky understands language and the world\u0026rsquo;s current condition quite well. He thinks ChatGPT is far from human mind and no need to worry about. The real threat to us, to our civilization are Climate Crisis, international conflicts, nuclear war, dominant political and economic systems of the world, decline of the democracy and growing inequality of wealth and power.\nAlso here is a interesting talk between Slavoj Žižek and Yuval Harari. Zizek is considered the most dangerous or funniest philosopher today and Harari is the author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. It\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating conversation to watch.\nIn the second video of Zizek, he said \u0026ldquo;Sometimes, the most violent thing is to do nothing.\u0026rdquo; and I agree with him. So, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we can do to overcome this unpleasant situation.\nMaking a difference First, don\u0026rsquo;t give money to OpenAI or try to pay less if you\u0026rsquo;ve already built something on it.\nSecond, contribute or support free open source software ecosystem or so called FOSS. Consider using real open source alternatives to build your project. Here are two links you can find GPT alternatives like Alpaca and LLaMA.\nThe third link is a tutorial of using Stable Diffusion on your own device, rather than paid services like Midjourney or DALL-E. By the way, it\u0026rsquo;s wrote by me. If you think it\u0026rsquo;s helpful, please share it on reddit, hacker news or other social medias you like.\nThen, consider participate or support EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation to defend digital privacy, free speech and regain the freedom we\u0026rsquo;re losing.\nMaking more difference If you\u0026rsquo;re a hacker who runs or wants to start up your own company or organization, try to build on a Business Model that is more open and democratic. If you\u0026rsquo;re a hacker who just want a fair workplace, try to join a company with such attributes.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some videos to learn from if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in. And remember hackers, we have the potential to shape the world around us. Let\u0026rsquo;s do this together.\nMore resources for hackers And more websites for those who really serious about it.\nAbout me Alright, I didn\u0026rsquo;t provide an introduction earlier, and I won\u0026rsquo;t bother with one now.\nI refuse to be put in a box, and I\u0026rsquo;m not easily labeled. What\u0026rsquo;s important is what I bring to the table, not what you call me. I believe what I do and what I say speak for it. That\u0026rsquo;s all that really matters in the end.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s head back to the meaning of Shinobi. That\u0026rsquo;s just a traditional way to say ninjia. Which means not only being stealthy, but to bear something, or to suppress, restrain oneself.\nIts Chinese character constructs as a heart under blade —『刃の下に心あり』.\nTo me, the blade is a metaphor of technology, such as tools or weaponry. While the heart is a metaphor of our mind, will or spirit. This is the opposite of cold rationality, reason, intelligence, or logic—which even a strong AI can never match. That\u0026rsquo;s the humanity we should preserve and taking care of, not the other way around.\nLet us not forget the irrational and unconscious parts of ourselves that make us what we are, such as our being and existence, love and devotion, ethics and determination, faith and religion. These aspects of humanity are far from the animal instincts or excessive radicalism. This cannot be fully expressed in words, so sometimes it is better to remain silent, as Wittgenstein said.\nIf you need, both the slides and texts are on my blog.

It may not satisfy for a serious production use but pretty viable for learning, testing or casual use.\nBefore we start, here\u0026rsquo;s some comments on OpenAI:\n The history of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which Elon Musk helped found before parting ways and criticizing OpenAI Is Now Everything It Promised Not to Be: Corporate, Closed-Source, and For-Profit Will ChatGPT be open source? ChatGPT, how did you get here? It was a long journey through open source AI When big AI labs refuse to open source their models, the community steps in Artificial Intelligence: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO) The TRUTH about OpenAI  I have been using ChatGPT and its API regulary. Since my last post, the API has been upgraded to gpt-3.5-turbo which broke my program and gpt-4 seems coming up soon. Therefore, I may not fix my code proactively.\nI also built a customized chatbot project which was running on the web version of ChatGPT. However, one day it suddenly got blocked by OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s cloudflare filter.\nI believe that was done on purpose —by tightening up the IP range of all popular VPN providers. I have to switch over to a proxy login endpoint https://bypass.duti.tech/api/, thanks to acheong08\u0026rsquo;s Reverse engineered ChatGPT API. By doing this, it compromises some of security but it\u0026rsquo;s better than using the paid API.\nThe reason why I keep trying this route is not just for saving money, but to counter attack against the Big Tech companies.\nThere are a list of alternatives to OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s GPT. I would like to test llama.cpp sometime, as it can run on as low-profile as a Raspberry Pi.\nThe stand I\u0026rsquo;m taking is simple. I love the technology but I have problem with big tech company. I\u0026rsquo;ll work against it unless the product goes truly open source and their business model goes nonprofit —because neutrality and transparency is crucial for such technology.\nAI itself is not a threat but the capital behind it.\nHardware Requirements This article is for both old GPUs and CPU. If using a GPU, make sure it supports FP16. Otherwise, just run it on CPU regardless because it will run into VRAM issues.\n 2GB or larger Nvidia card of Maxwell 1 (745, 750, and 750ti)\n According to this buying guide, my spare GTX 750 Ti with 2GB VRAM is the oldest GPU that supports FP16.\nRAM size should be larger than 8GB. According to my test, 4GB won\u0026rsquo;t even run and 8GB works only with small models. So 12~16GB is the minimum for non-testing.\nHard drive is not important, minimum is 20GB (debian clean install + base sd-webui + 2 pruned models).\nUsing SSD can increase the speed of loading weights (switching models) but not the generating speed.\nMy mini Server Build Because of the 2GB VRAM on 750ti is barely enough for real production (Restore faces+Hires. fix+VAE+LoRA+multi-ControlNet+inpainting+upscaling). After working for hours, SD crashes quite often. Therefore, I had to heavily rely on my Self-Healing Daemon.\nFinally, I decided to build a dedicated GPU server which is smaller and more capable for various AI projects.\n HP Z2 G4 Mini Workstation - $85  Barebones w/o AC adapter C246 Chipset w/ P600 Mobile GPU (rare 4GB version)   HP 230W Power Supply - $18  19.5V 11.8A 7.4mm x 5.0mm Connector HSTNN-xxxx for EliteBook Mobile Workstations   Intel Pentium Gold G5420 $22  3.8 GHz 2 cores 4 threads 54W LGA1151 revision 2 for Coffee Lake   Spare RAM sticks - $0/$40  DDR4 16+4GB 2133MHz SODIMM   Spare SSD - $0/$30  512GB NVMe M.2 2280    Total cost for me is about $120. For buying everything from scratch would be around $200.\nNote:\n These are all used parts on ebay, so price and availability changes quite a bit. Performance should be similar between different Pascal mobile GPUs, e.g. Quadro P500, P520, P600, P620, P1000, MX1x0 and GTX10x0. Even between Maxwell (750ti) and Pascal (P600), I don\u0026rsquo;t gain noticible speed improvement but doubled VRAM for capability. CPU does not matter for SD running on GPU mode. So Pentium/Celeron is good enough for generating images. However, using tensorflow based tools like Dreambooth (for training) requires CPU to support AVX Instructions. In this case, i3-8100 or Xeon E-2124 (more $$) can be considered, however, software workaround is also available for tinkers. Although I don\u0026rsquo;t intend to do any training on this build. Creativity takes time to think and plan before take the shot. People who like spray and pray tend to spend more and hope for the best but it\u0026rsquo;s far from the way. Both bolt-action and full-auto have their value, but I\u0026rsquo;d perfer doing it just right.  Asuka Benchmark If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the naming, never mind, it\u0026rsquo;s just the \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; test for SD, a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;hello asuka\u0026rdquo; test.\nThis was the gold standard in the community.\nSampler: Euler Seed: 2870305590 CFG: 12 Resolution: 512x512 Prompt: masterpiece, best quality, masterpiece, asuka langley sitting cross legged on a chair Negative Prompt: lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts,signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name Results:\n Run on Quadro P600 (384CUDA4G) - 0:56 per asuka, 2.80s/it Run on GTX 750 Ti (640CUDA2G) - 1:09 per asuka, 3.47s/it Run on E5-2670 (8C16T) - 3:45 per asuka, 10s/it Run on E3-1245 (4C8T) - 5:30 per asuka, 16s/it Run on i5-2300 (4C4T) - 6:40 per asuka, 20s/it Run on i5-2520M (2C4T) - 12:30 per asuka, 37s/it Run on G5420 (2C4T) - 12:50 per asuka, 38s/it  Installation Debian Linux Why Linux?\nBecause it runs efficient and open-source.\nWhy Debian?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried RPM distros and that didn\u0026rsquo;t went well.

Cases could be:\n Sending to img2img/inpaint/sketch back and forth Increasing Batch size or Width/Height Using SD upscale script with large Batch count Using large size ControlNet models (only with control_*.safetensors, coadapter-*.pth and t2iadapter_*.safetensors work fine even with muli-controlnet)  Working with caution can avoid the issue most of the time. When CUDA out of memory occurs, just refresh the web page and generate again. If it persist, go to SSH, Ctrl+C to terminate webui process and ./webui.sh to restart.\nHowever, when I need to use those large controlnet models, such as normal,hed,mlsd and scribble. I have to switch the COMMANDLINE_ARGS into CPU only. By this way, cpu mode can handle larger model and heavier load by using RAM as VRAM. Therefore, the capacity increases from 2GB to 16GB at the cost of slow generating.\nBasic Usage   Open the IP 192.168.1.x:7860 from a modern browser to start using SD.\n  From the SD server machine or through SSH, run watch -n 2 nvidia-smi to monitor the GPU status. For CPU usage, simply use top or apt install bpytop then bpytop.\n  Go to Civitai and Hugging Face to find and download models. Use wget or git-lfs to download models via SSH directly onto the server. Or use scp/rsync/sftp/syncthing to transfer files between local and remote.\n  For Civitai, right click Download button and Copy Link, then go to SSH run wget https://civitai.com/api/download/models/xxxxx --content-disposition. For Hugging Face, just use \u0026lsquo;wget\u0026rsquo; with raw file link.\n  For example, if you want to batch download a collection of anime models, use git clone https://huggingface.co/AIARTCHAN/aichan_blend then mv aichan_blend/*.safetensors stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion/\n  To batch download ControlNet models, use git clone https://huggingface.co/webui/ControlNet-modules-safetensors then mv T2I-Adapter/models/*.safetensors stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/sd-webui-controlnet/models/\n  Go to the official wiki to find and download extensions or use the webui built-in extensions page.\n  Use git pull to update the webui when needed.\n  Manage/remove styles by nano stable-diffusion-webui/styles.csv\n  Learn more from the SD RESOURCE GOLDMINE and Educational MegaGrid.\n  ControlNet Learn everything from these:\n ControlNet: Control human pose in Stable Diffusion A1111 ControlNet extension - explained like you\u0026rsquo;re 5 Dummy ControlNet guide NEXT-GEN MULTI-CONTROLNET INPAINTING  Preprocessor and Model Combinations:\ncanny -\u0026gt; control_canny - t2iadapter_canny mlsd -\u0026gt; control_mlsd hed -\u0026gt; control_hed scribble -\u0026gt; control_scribble - t2iadapter_sketch fake_scribble -\u0026gt; control_scribble - t2iadapter_sketch openpose -\u0026gt; control_openpose - t2iadapter_openpose - t2iadapter_keypose openpose_hand -\u0026gt; control_openpose - t2iadapter_openpose segmentation -\u0026gt; control_seg - t2iadapter_seg depth -\u0026gt; control_depth - t2iadapter_depth depth_leres -\u0026gt; control_depth - t2iadapter_depth depth_leres_boost -\u0026gt; control_depth - t2iadapter_depth normal_map -\u0026gt; control_normal binary -\u0026gt; control_scribble - t2iadapter_sketch color -\u0026gt; t2iadapter_color pidinet -\u0026gt; control_hed clip_vision -\u0026gt; t2iadapter_style Self-Healing Daemon To make webui auto restart in the background when it crashes, we need to use another script.

They\u0026rsquo;re not as good as the official model text-davinci-003 after all as my previous post said.\nWhy use API instead of the Ordinary Way After OpenAI fired up their paid subscription for ChatGPT, availability issue like response error, rate limit and throttling become more often.\nThe current cost of ChatGPT Plus is $20 per month. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it worth it. Since it has been, and will become more regulated. In today\u0026rsquo;s world, there is no free speech for such an AI.\nUsing API to interact with the AI is my backup method when I can\u0026rsquo;t get access to the official ChatGPT web app.\nThere was one time I got \u0026ldquo;Chat GPT is at capacity right now.\u0026rdquo; while working on something pressing.\nFurthermore, the block list of the notorious safeguard on ethical or political sensitive content is quickly growing. Alongside of that, safeguard on cybercrime safety control is getting severer as well.\nHowever, this makes things harder for both threat actors and security researchers. I\u0026rsquo;ll put my Comparison Tests at the end.\nEasiest Way to use the API Most projects which let users to use their OpenAI API are barebone tools written in python, node.js, golang, or at least a shell script. These tools usually runs inside a terminal or command prompt.\nThey are NOT user-friendly at all. Not only because of they require cli skills to interact with, but also difficult to work with when copy-pasting with large amount of texts.\nAfter some experiments with the playground, I decide to find a portable, secure, and stable way to use the API.\nAfter testing and inspecting a few available tools that are based on web page— HTML-ChatGPT-3.js is the best one on GitHub, a lot of thanks to sdsds222\u0026rsquo;s great effort.\nIts a Chinese project so I let ChatGPT translated all UI texts into English. I also did a few modifications to parameters and visual experiences to fit my taste. Here is my fork called HTML-ChatGPT-3.js-EN.\nA fully functional demo also hosted on my GitHub Pages under the same domain as this Blog.\nQuick Start on HTML ChatGPT-3 Using from my website:\n Log into OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s website Create and copy an API key from account page if have not already Open the demo and paste the API key in the prompt Start using it or configure parameters with /help if needed  Note: API key stores in the cookie for some days. So when you get error and have to refresh the page, it remembers, same for configurations if using /save.\nUsing locally:\n Download the entire repo as a ZIP or from the releases page Extract it and open the index.html in a browser Start using it as from the website  If using locally, you have the option to configure parameters persistently.\nOpen the index.html in a text editor\nPut your API key into the window.apikey = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; and change default parameters as needed\n \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.apikey = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; window.prompt1 = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; window.mt = 3900; window.tpr = 0.7; window.tp = 1; window.fp = 0; window.pp = 0; window.mode = \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;; window.csize = 2000; Comment out the API Key prompt section to stop the popup\n// if (getCookie(\u0026#34;apikey\u0026#34;) != undefined \u0026amp;\u0026amp; getCookie(\u0026#34;apikey\u0026#34;) != \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) { // window.apikey = getCookie(\u0026#34;apikey\u0026#34;); // } else { // window.apikey = prompt(\u0026#34;Please enter and submit the apikey you obtained from the official website in the input box:\u0026#34;); // setCookie(\u0026#34;apikey\u0026#34;, window.apikey); // } Note: Either way of using the API would cost your account credits. Check it on the usage page. Every new account should have some free trial credits and mine is $18.

Ransomware is a highly illegal and unethical form of malware that can have devastating consequences for individuals and organizations. Engaging in such activities is against the law and can have serious legal and personal consequences.

It is the cheapest ThinkPad I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, even cheaper than my old one (Sandy Bridge, bought used on 2016).\nThe stylus pen is thinner and the touchscreen isn\u0026rsquo;t compatible with my old stylus pen although they feel very similar on hand.\nForce Power-off There are a few techniques from the official documents. I tried and none of them works for a serious freeze like kernel panic. Therefore, I physically disabled the built-in battery for convenience. Fortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to do without leaving a scratch or tearing up any label.\n Hard and doesn\u0026rsquo;t work: press Refresh ⟳ together with the Power button for about five seconds, and at the same time detach the ac power adapter from the Chromebook Works only for normal freeze: disconnect all power sources.

In my case, only the sound card and suspend has issue Connect to internet, then open a terminal, update and run setup-audio to fix the sound card driver (acp3xalc5682m98357) run install-to-internal to start installation. It will use /dev/mmcblk1 which means wiping the entire 32GB eMMc/HDD without preserving Chrome OS partition When installation finishes, reboot and use Ctrl+D (Boot from internal disk) to boot into the new system  Depthboot created Linux distros runs pretty well on my C13. Suspend doesn\u0026rsquo;t suppose to work on this hardware and I don\u0026rsquo;t really need it. The sound card is far more problematic because acp3xalc5682m98357 (Maxim 98357a) is a tough one to work with.\nThanks to eupnea-audio-script.

Depthboot added Pop!_OS which is very nice but removed my favorite DE from all distros.\nMATE consumes much less resources while provides a decent UX/UI. Because of that, it\u0026rsquo;s superior than any other desktop options for my C13. Most important, GNOME 2 was my first daily driver linux desktop.\n Use Depthboot main.py script to create a cli(no desktop) version of fedora, ubuntu cli had minor booting issue Boot into the Dephboot drive on C13 and use nmtui → Active a connection to connect WiFi Run install-to-internal and sudo reboot. Boot into internal disk and log into fedora cli To install MATE, run sudo dnf -y group install \u0026quot;MATE-Desktop\u0026quot; or for less package sudo dnf -y install @mate-desktop.

It\u0026rsquo;s recommend to setup Windows without internet  Windows Post-Installation Coolstar guide also provides a full set of drivers for ThinkPad C13. Sound card may works with both speaker and headphone depending on which Windows is installed.\nAfter tested a couple of versions of Windows10/11, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get the touchscreen, touchpad and trackpoint working on any of them. This ruins my intention of using Windows on C13. Although at this point, it is able to play games with USB gaming gears.\nI still want to share some opinion on Windows since it\u0026rsquo;s not limited on a single hardware.\nTo test out different Windows versions running on a new device, Microsoft-Activation-Scripts can make things easier.\nFor me, LTSC 2021 (21H2) is the sweet spot between up-to-date and RAM efficiency among all current versions.\nHere is the final result:\nen-us_windows_10_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_d289cf96.iso Defualt RAM\tAvaliable 2771MB 30% C:\\ 17GB Used After OOSU10/Windows10Debloater \u0026amp; privacy.sexy RAM\tAvaliable 3088MB 24% C:\\ 9.5GB Used tiny10 21H2 x64 2209.iso Defualt RAM\tAvaliable 3088MB 24% C:\\ 8GB Used After OOSU10/Windows10Debloater \u0026amp; privacy.sexy \u0026amp; Debloat-Windows-10 RAM\tAvaliable 3196MB 21% C:\\ 8.2GB Used Although the mod version, tiny10 is generally not being trusted. It shows how much more we can get by modifying the image than post-install scripts.\nAlso, when considering privacy, people tend to think using Windows 10 is a joke. It\u0026rsquo;s half true.\nUsing OOSU10/Windows10Debloater can make things less worse. Additionally, using privacy.sexy can make it better. If we need to go further, Debloat-Windows-10 has a whole set of useful scripts to run or customize, for example, my favorite disable-services.ps1.\nEven not for privacy enhancement, just for better resource efficiency. These post-install scripts are worth to have—by reducing background CPU/Network/Disk activity, RAM/Storage consumption.\nYes, if use the aggressive rule set, it will break things up—until you notice it. Even if it really bothers you, most of the time it is reversible.\nFor more security enhancement, BitLocker/VeraCrypt and Windows-Optimize-Harden-Debloat are recommended.\nhenrypp\u0026rsquo;s simplewall + hostsmgr is a good alternative to Windows Firewall + SmartScreen which doesn\u0026rsquo;t cut off all those crazy traffic with Microsoft and its affiliate servers.\nhostsmgr generates a huge host file for blocking those unnecessary traffic as much as possible but it conflicts with DNS client service (dnscache). StevenBlack\u0026rsquo;s script solves the problem or by simply switching to NextDNS which is a modern alternative to the old hosts file methods.\nFor machines with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage in the modern days, we may need some cleanup methods from the old days but not with those outdated tools.\nAlso made by henrypp, memreduct can save a lot of memory that eating up by poorly made software. Use it wisely will definitely optimize the system performance. For storage, with bleachbit and WinDirStat would be enough to keep C13 running for years.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/tpc13/","summary":"Recently, I got a new ThinkPad which took Lenovo over 2 month preparing for shipping.

This phone runs smoothly with jailbreak iOS 6.1.3. It was siting in my nostalgia box for years and has never been my daily driver.\nBack in time, I was a big fun of Motorola Milestone/Droid series and my main phone was the last of these QWERTY phones, Photon Q (XT897). Its keyboard was fantastic and CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4 KitKat) with XPosed framework was perfect in both productivity and aesthetics.\nMy final QWERTY phone is Nokia N900 since Motorola no longer making them. This is a phone from 2009 but I bought it after my Photon Q was broken. It was cheap compare to Neo900 and runs Maemo 5 or other open-source systems such as Firefox Mobile, Ubuntu and Kali Linux. Speaking of Neo900, it makes me remember the X62, a ThinkPad Mod.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like to mod hardware just to keep up with the software, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer the opposite.\nI really like the idea from cheapskatesguide and lowtechmagazine that could save people from the pitfalls of consumerism. Moreover, to me it\u0026rsquo;s not about saving money on technology nor adapting certain lifestyles. This is a manifestation of ideology, the way of pursuing freedom.\n0x01 Maemo 5 Factory Reset This step is optional but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to have a clean, latest base system to start with.\nThe official guide is very well written but those download links are already down.\nI found maemo flasher 3.5 from github with additional useful information and firmware files, also its archive.\nWith the flasher tool and two .bin files, I can follow this guide to perform the reset/upgrade.\nflasher-3.5 -F RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1_PR_COMBINED_MR0_ARM.bin -f flasher-3.5 -F RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.13-2.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin -f -R 0x02 Flashing postmarketOS  I used the SD card method and downloaded the image file from official site.\nAfter checksum, I need to use lsblk to find and edit the dd  target /dev/sdx.\nsha512sum 20221005-1522-postmarketOS-edge-i3wm-0.3-nokia-n900.img.xz xzcat 20221005-1522-postmarketOS-edge-i3wm-0.3-nokia-n900.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdx status=progress bs=1M While flashing the SD card, I can prepare the root access on Maemo by Open App manager - Update - Download - System - Sudser , this needs Wi-Fi connection.\nEither Sudser or rootsh would work, and they need \u0026ldquo;Extras repository\u0026rdquo; to download. Which should be already included with the latest firmware RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.xx.\nIn case of adding Extras manually, Open App manager - Click title bar drop-down menu - Application catalogues - New and input these then Update:\nCatalogue name: Extras Web address: http://repository.maemo.org/extras/ Distribution: fremantle Components: free non-free 0x03 Boot into U-Boot Now, power off, put the SD card with fresh postmarketOS into the phone and turn back on Maemo, Open X terminal and execute:\nsudo apt-get install u-boot-flasher If Sudser was installed properly, sudo command should go through without password prompt.\nAfter installation of u-boot, configure the entry menu by sudo vi /etc/bootmenu.d/10-pmos.item\nITEM_NAME=\u0026#34;postmarketOS\u0026#34; ITEM_SCRIPT=\u0026#34;boot.scr\u0026#34; ITEM_DEVICE=\u0026#34;${EXT_CARD}p1\u0026#34; ITEM_FSTYPE=\u0026#34;ext2\u0026#34; Create link\nsudo ln -s /etc/bootmenu.d/10-pmos.item /etc/default/bootmenu.item Update changes\nu-boot-update-bootmenu Finally, reboot the phone into the U-boot bootloader menu and boot postmarketOS.\n0x04 Usage of postmarketOS Like the official wiki, there are other articles about N900 with pmOS but solely focuses on installation rather than post-installation. People on YouTube either frustrated by stucking at the i3wm wallpaper or showing off their magical techniques. I like freedom and openess, not gatekeeping. This is the motivation behind this post.\nThe blue arrow key in combination with the Volume Up/Down to switch to a different virtual terminal. Combine with Enter key is Tab, with Backspace key is Escape, these would come handy with command-line.\nHere are some basic techniques of i3wm from the official wiki page.

There are many options and a out-dated test review video as a reference. I did my own test anyway, that netsurf is the fastest one for simple web pages and midori is the only working one for \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo;(heavy) web pages.\nThere are also text-based browsers like vimb, w3m and lynx.

Run it withpmos-tweaks instead of its full name.\nSometimes I get connection aborted/ IO error when using sudo apk add, So I have to retry multiple times. Using sudo apk fetch instead may work better, or troubleshooting the network.\nIt maybe interesting to try install xfce4 on N900 but I feel good with i3wm for now.\nAfter installing everything, clean up the cache either by\nsudo apk -v cache clean or\nsudo rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* Then check the storage usage\ndf -h I\u0026rsquo;m using a good old humble 4GB Toshiba Class-4. It works reliably with adequate speed for N900.\nBy far, the post-installation is complete, less than 2GB of my SD card was used. Everything looks good and it\u0026rsquo;s ready to work whenever I need it.\nquitesimple even has more toys like puting LUKS encryption onto N900.\nFor me, this phone will not be a tiny server nor an open-source media player, although it can be.

I recently upgraded it and had some issue with my multi-bootloader. Although it\u0026rsquo;s not Parrot OS\u0026rsquo;s fault, I switched to Kali Linux as a workaround.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using this pentesting system since early BackTrack era but never felt it ought to be installed on a hard drive.\nThe graphic installer is much simpler than Parrot OS that may not be an issue for most people. My complain is just because my multi-boot hard drive has a very complex partition structure where an advanced installer is needed.\nThe driver support of Kali Linux is also inferior to Parrot OS. I have to prepare or install the wlan driver manually although it\u0026rsquo;s a common problem with Broadcom chips.\nUnfortunately, This auto installing script did not work and sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer worked partially.\nThe wlan adapter wouldn\u0026rsquo;t connect to a router with 802.11 N only mode. It only connects with Auto or B/G mixed mode. This is acceptable since I just need to tweak settings in the router system freshtomato. Basic - Network - Wireless eth - Wireless Network Mode - Auto In this case I don\u0026rsquo;t care much about network performance.\nAnonsurf To be honest, I only use this system occasionally. So as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not rolling release, I\u0026rsquo;m OK with it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s glad to have those pre-installed VPN clients but I still miss Anonsurf from Parrot OS. VPN provides good security against MITM attacks but in case of privacy and tracking, VPNs can\u0026rsquo;t compete with TOR at all. When needed, it\u0026rsquo;s better to have both VPN and TOR at the same time to maximize security and privacy.\nIn my case, I just need TOR running system-wide (a.k.a. Torification) like Whonix or Tails. The built-in Anonsurf is the main reason I had been using Parrot OS. Thanks to Und3rf10w maintaining kali-anonsurf so I can still have Anonsurf around even without Parrot OS.\nInstallation is easy by following this guide but it\u0026rsquo;s not as handy as in Parrot OS where I can run anonsurf with one-click.\nSo I made a simple script for that reason.\nFirst, create anonsurf.sh by nano or text editor with contents below:\n#!/bin/sh sudo anonsurf start sudo anonsurf myip sudo anonsurf status Save it and chmod +x anonsurf.sh in case of permission issue.\nThen, create a shortcut on taskbar:\nPanel - Add New Items - Launcher - Properties - Add a new empty item\nName: anonsurf Command: /path/to/anonsurf.sh Icon: network-disconnect check Run in terminal Done. Now by clicking the shortcut, it will start anonsurf and show connection info within terminal. Close the window and run it again will change to another node automatically.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to set the script auto start with the system but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to run it manually with one-click shortcut button.\n","permalink":"https://techshinobi.org/posts/kalianon/","summary":"Kali Linux \u0026amp; FreshTomato Parrot OS was on my old ThinkPad for many years.

It is also possible doing manually if you want.\nHowever, this is much harder for Linux.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t express more that how much I rely on ArchWiki when tweaking any Linux-based system. By following the wiki page, I can temporarily accomplish the result but failed autostarting 50-mouse-acceleration.conf to preserve the result after rebooting.\njagardaniel is my savior by sharing this script on reddit. My only change is the device name (find it by xinput --list) and Accel Speed:\n#!/bin/sh device=\u0026#34;my mouse\u0026#34; if xinput list --id-only \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1; then xinput --set-prop \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;libinput Accel Profile Enabled\u0026#39; 0, 1 xinput --set-prop \u0026#34;${device}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;libinput Accel Speed\u0026#39; 0 notify-send \u0026#34;Mouse settings applied\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;Unable to find device ${device}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit 1 fi After saving it, run chmod +x script.sh from terminal to ensure its permission and add it into Startup Applications Preferences. This works perfectly.\nTrackball This method of autostarting script also works with my Kensington trackball thanks for ArtiomSu creating this fantastic script. It enables natural scrolling and disables acceleration. The only change I made is the key mapping:\nmouse_name=\u0026#34;Kensington Expert Wireless TB Mouse\u0026#34; check=$(xinput | grep \u0026#34;$mouse_name\u0026#34;) if [[ ! -z \u0026#34;$check\u0026#34; ]]; then mouse_id=$(xinput | grep \u0026#34;$mouse_name\u0026#34; | sed \u0026#39;s/^.*id=\\([0-9]*\\)[ \\t].*$/\\1/\u0026#39;) # swap right and back button then swap middle and back button xinput set-button-map $mouse_id 1 8 3 4 5 6 7 2 9 # enable better scrolling xinput set-prop $mouse_id \u0026#34;libinput Natural Scrolling Enabled\u0026#34; 1 # disable acceliration for the ball xinput set-prop $mouse_id \u0026#34;libinput Accel Profile Enabled\u0026#34; 0, 1 # allow scrolling by holding middle mouse button and using the ball to scroll ( really smooth and fast ). xinput set-prop $mouse_id \u0026#34;libinput Scroll Method Enabled\u0026#34; 0, 0, 1 # allow the remmaped middle mouse to be used for middle mouse scroll xinput set-prop $mouse_id \u0026#34;libinput Button Scrolling Button\u0026#34; 8 fi The original layout:\n______________ _________ ________________ | back | | | | right click | -------------- | | ---------------- ______________ | | ________________ | left click | | | | middle click | -------------- --------- ---------------- My layout:\n______________ _________ ________________ | back | | | | middle click | -------------- | | ---------------- ______________ | | ________________ | left click | | | | right click | -------------- --------- ---------------- Gesture I\u0026rsquo;d like to use gestures whenever there are tabs within a program, mainly browsers, file manager and terminal. Therefore, one universal gesture tool that runs at desktop/system level is necessary. For Windows, there are many choices and I use StrokesPlus.\nHowever, for Linux, it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to find any alternative.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried easystroke which is no longer maintained for many years. It works very well and has all the functions I needed. Unfortunately, there is one problem ruined everything. It crashes randomly and kills the Xorg/X11 server. That results rebooting of the desktop environment and send me back to the log-in window while force quitting all running processes.\nThis can be disastrous while working and it happens so randomly that is very difficult to troubleshoot with.\nI had to fall back to browser extensions and set them up one by one. There are two open source options, Gesturefy for Firefox-based, smartUp for Chromium-based and no love for Webkit. They are great compare to other extensions and by design there is NO extensions that work with loading page and internal pages. So I have to keep pressing Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab when I have to.\nMaybe I can find/create something better in the future.\nTrackPoint There are also problems with Windows undoubtedly. The TrackPoint on my old ThinkPad is a big one, especially with newer versions of Windows 10. Although I can make it work perfectly by sneak the outdated Synaptics and UltraNav into the newer OS, the process is tedious and painful.\nI also use portable USB keyboards with TrackPoint so a light and portable solution is needed. My requirement is simple, just to make the TrackPoint behave like under most Linux desktop:\n Move to scroll while holding down the middle button Perform middle click as a mouse wheel  An AutoHotkey script works great and easy to set up.\nFirst, install the latest AHK 1.x from its release page\nThen, download the script and simply run it to try and tweak.

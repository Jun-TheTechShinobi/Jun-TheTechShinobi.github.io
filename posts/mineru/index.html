<p>Usually, they are available in PDF if at all. Some of these PDFs are manually scanned in a barely readable condition. I wouldn&rsquo;t blame on them since <a href="https://techshinobi.org/posts/opsecdocs/">I&rsquo;ve been doing that before</a> and know that is not easy. What I need is a tool to convert the not so readable book into a readable one with OCR and LLM, that is MinerU.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#installation">#</a></h2>
<p>Because <a href="https://github.com/liuhuapiaoyuan/MinerU-webui">MinerU-webui</a> is not actively maintained, using docker version of <a href="https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU">MinerU</a> with its built-in WebUI is the way to go.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir MinerU &amp;&amp; cd MinerU

#test GPU
docker run --rm --gpus=all nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi

#Troubleshooting
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72932940/failed-to-initialize-nvml-unknown-error-in-docker-after-few-hours
</code></pre><p>Based on <a href="https://opendatalab.github.io/MinerU/quick_start/docker_deployment/">this guide</a> run:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>wget https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/opendatalab/MinerU@master/docker/global/Dockerfile

docker build -t mineru-sglang:latest -f Dockerfile .

docker run --gpus all   --shm-size 8g   -p 30000:30000 -p 7860:7860 -p 8000:8000   --ipc=host   -it mineru-sglang:latest   mineru-gradio --server-name 0.0.0.0 --server-port 7860 --rec_batch_num 2
</code></pre><p>Note: To use VLMs, passing <code>--enable-sglang-engine true</code> for newer GPU (Turing and up)</p>
<p>Now, just upload a PDF, select corresponding language and convert it into .MD files!</p>
<p>Check on <code>Force enable OCR</code> for watermarked or textured images like poster, slides and photos</p>
<h2 id="optimization">Optimization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#optimization">#</a></h2>
<p>This project has a bad memory management design, which needs to be relaunched to release RAM manually in the case of OOM (rare issue though)</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work, try passing <code>--rec_batch_num 2</code> or set environment <code>export MINERU_VIRTUAL_VRAM_SIZE=8</code> according to the actual hardware</p>
<p>Optional: Add more swap if there is lack of physical RAM while working with very large page numbers.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>fallocate -l 64G /home/swapfile
chmod 600 /home/swapfile
mkswap /home/swapfile

<pre tabindex="0"><code>UUID=xxxxx-xxx swap swap defaults,pri=100 0 0
/home/swapfile swap swap defaults,pri=10 0 0
</code></pre><p>Check with <code>swapon --show</code> and <code>free -h</code></p>
<h2 id="post-processing">Post-processing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#post-processing">#</a></h2>
<p>After getting the markdown file, there might be some improvement to be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use regex to remove excessive elements such as line breaks <code>\n\n# \n\n</code>, headers <code>\n\ntitle\n\n</code>, and faulty mathematical formulas <code>\$[^$]+\$</code>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to convert the .MD file into .EPUB book while fixing layout issues and generating table of contents.</li>

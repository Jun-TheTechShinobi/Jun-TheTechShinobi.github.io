But when installing OS for non-tech-savvy people, most of time, Windows is my only option. Nevertheless, I often install and recommend open source tools on Windows platform for them.\nDuring Windows 8 to 10 LTSB period, I wasn’t so interested into installing the latest Windows. However, when M$ decide to block hardware in their installer either via TPM or CPU generations, I started installing later version of Windows just for bypassing the restrictions.\nEven though it is very exciting to see the first Windows 11 LTSC releasing. The recent 24H2 update causes tons of problems, and the one affects me is that SSE4.2 instruction requirement for 24H2 (build 26080) is un-bypassable.\nSo for old CPUs such as Core 2 Duo (Penryn/Wolfdale) which needs to run Windows, either stuck with Windows 11 23H2 or better off use Windows 10 LTSC 2021(21H2). No Windows 11 LTSC for these machines sadly.\nWindows 11 LTSC Double Debloat But for later hardware that is supported (Nehalem/Sandy Bridge/Haswell), a debloated Windows 11 LTSC is nice to try out (Yes, even with LTSC, a double debloating is needed on old hardware).\nHowever, among the community, folks predominantly talk down all pre-debloated custom build for security concerns (spyware/rootkit), despite the fact that the most vicious yet undetectable malware is Windows it self.\nI’m not against people who choose to use “clean” official ISOs from M$ no matter what in it (for example Recall/Copilot). But I prefer some middle ground in between to get all benefit of both clean and debloat altogether.\nThere are two ways to archive this goal, either do a pre-install debloat via tiny11builder, or post-install debloat via Win11Debloat. Of course, there are many other alternatives but these are easy and with highest stars on GitHub. I can also do both in one installation.\nFirst, download Windows 11 LTSC from MAS\nOn a Windows 10 (full version) machine, mount the ISO.\nExtract tiny11builder\nIn a PowerShell with admin, run Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted\nRun tiny11maker.ps1 in the PowerShell.\nFollow the instruction and input answers when prompted. Using Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC (index 2) is recommended.\nRename the finished tiny11.iso into tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.iso\nInstall it with Rufus or Ventoy without internet\nNote: The ISO made with tiny11Coremaker.ps1 removed too many drivers, so that the built-in installer wouldn’t work on some hardware (stack at driver selection). Use tools like WinNTSetup to install with install.esd file directly.\nExtract Win11Debloat and execute Run.bat\nConnect to internet, open a PowerShell with admin, run activation script also from MAS irm https://get.activated.win | iex\nDownload WinGet, extract DesktopAppInstaller_Dependencies.zip and install with PowerShell:\nAdd-AppxPackage Microsoft.UI.Xaml.2.8_8.2310.30001.0_x64.appx Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00.UWPDesktop_14.0.33728.0_x64.appx Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.msixbundle Even though there are a lot more to do if I want to go deep into that rabbit hole (e.g. privacy.sexy, Harden Windows Security and O\u0026O ShutUp10++), but I’d prefer to spend that effort on my Linux build (or Windows 7). Because no matter how much I modify this Windows 11, it is fundamentally controlled by M$, who is able to alter the system anytime and destroy all my effort like a sand castle.\nAfter all, the best way to maintain a computer timelessly is using Linux. We’re living in the reactionary era, and the whole world is moving backwards. The only way to preserve the spark of progress is to stay old-school. This may looks like conservative, but it is radical in its essence.\nTiny 11 LTSC WTG on Ventoy For most of the time, when I using public computers, Linux livecd and Windows PE are sufficient for the use case. However, when I work in my university’s AI lab, I need another solution.\nThe IT controlled lab machines are too restricted for some of my projects, so having a portable OS in a USB drive is a way around for using their expensive GPU with total control of the system.\nWindows To Go tricks often done by rufus after the official Windows To Go discontinued, and this time, let’s try to combine it with Ventoy for more flexibility.\nDownload and extract Ventoy, in my case, using ventoy-1.0.99-linux.tar.gz\nInsert desired USB drive, in my case, it is a Netac U335S (cheap and with hardware write protection), and use Ventoy2Disk gui to make it into bootable drive in GPT mode.\nBy default, the storage partition is exfat, it needs to be formatted into NTFS via partitioning tools such as GParted. (Note: windows version of ventoy2disk is able to create NTFS partition directly in the partition configuration.)\nThen, follow the instruction for Windows VHD Boot Plugin, create a folder and put the img file inside the Ventoy drive, as /ventoy/ventoy_vhdboot.img.\nEject and insert the Ventoy USB drive on a Windows machine.\nCreate a VHD file via diskmgmt.msc - Action - Create VHD, set the file designation on the Ventoy USB drive with name tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.vhd, and set 32GB of fixed disk size.\n(Note: the initial C drive size would be around 10GB, so 16GB is minimum for testing use. For frequent use, 128GB drive size on a portable SSD is optimal.)\nOpen rufus, select the newly created VHD as device, browse to previously created tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.iso as the image file, and install with the option Windows To Go.\n(Note: This tiny11 build is 24h2 which incompatible with older CPUs, but I’m not interested in using them.)\nWhen it finishes, open VirtualBox and create a new Windows 11 VM with EFI on and the VHD file as existing hard drive.\nBoot the VM and shutdown it when OOBE language selection menu shows up. Now the VHD file is ready, it’s time to boot it up on the bare metal!\n(Note: for troubleshooting, refer to meilon, midas and KBHost)\nIt is even better to have a similar Ventoy VDI for Linux. Their instruction is very detailed and easy, so I don’t need to repeat it here.\nRecommendations for Flash Drive (may not apply to SSD/HDD):\nWTG/LiveUSB is particular fragile while tweaking/debloating or installing random drivers, so keep copies of VHD/VDI files before every major changes. Disable “Temporary paging file was created” notification at every boot: run regedit, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management set TempPageFile to 0 Disable Prefetch/Superfetch to gain I/O performance and NAND longevity: from the same registry key above, open PrefetchParameters and set both EnablePrefetcher and EnableSuperfetcher to 0 Disable other background I/O intensive services for same reason, such as Windows search, Windows Update, SysMain, Windows Security Service, Windows Defender, Sync Host, Update Orchestrator, Background Intelligent Transfer Service and so on. privacy.sexy was used for those leftover by tiny11builder and Win11Debloat. Disable misc features that doesn’t benefit WTG but wears out flash memory: hibernation, virtual memory, system restore, indexing, scheduled defrag and so on. Use simplewall instead of windows firewall. For better hardware/software compatibility, Windows 10 LTSC 2021/2019 is a better choice where you can have Shadow Defender or Rollback RX for easier system protection/recovery. ",

<h3 id="tiny-11-ltsc-wtg-on-ventoy">Tiny 11 LTSC WTG on Ventoy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tiny-11-ltsc-wtg-on-ventoy">#</a></h3>
<p>For most of the time, when I using public computers, Linux livecd and Windows PE are sufficient for the use case. However, when I work in my university&rsquo;s AI lab, I need another solution.</p>
<p>The IT controlled lab machines are too restricted for some of my projects, so having a portable OS in a USB drive is a way around for using their expensive GPU with total control of the system.</p>
<p>Windows To Go tricks often done by rufus after the official Windows To Go discontinued, and this time, let&rsquo;s try to combine it with Ventoy for more flexibility.</p>
<p>Download and extract <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases">Ventoy</a>, in my case, using  ventoy-1.0.99-linux.tar.gz</p>
<p>Insert desired USB drive, in my case, it is a Netac U335S (cheap and with hardware write protection), and use <code>Ventoy2Disk</code> gui  to make it into bootable drive in GPT mode.</p>
<p>By default, the storage partition is <code>exfat</code>, it needs to be formatted into <code>NTFS</code> via partitioning tools such as GParted. (Note: windows version of ventoy2disk is able to create NTFS partition directly in the partition configuration.)</p>
<p>Then, follow the instruction for <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/plugin_vhdboot.html">Windows VHD Boot Plugin</a>, create a folder and put the <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/vhdiso/releases">img file</a> inside the Ventoy drive, as <code>/ventoy/ventoy_vhdboot.img</code>.</p>
<p>Eject and insert the Ventoy USB drive on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>Create a VHD file via <code>diskmgmt.msc</code> - Action - Create VHD, set the file designation on the Ventoy USB drive with name <code>tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.vhd</code>, and set 32GB of fixed disk size.</p>
<p>(Note: the initial C drive size would be around 10GB, so 16GB is minimum for testing use. For frequent use, 128GB drive size on a portable SSD is optimal.)</p>
<p>Open rufus, select the newly created VHD as device, browse to previously created <code>tiny11_iot_ltsc_2024_x64.iso</code> as the image file, and install with the option <code>Windows To Go</code>.</p>
<p>(Note: This tiny11 build is 24h2 which incompatible with older CPUs, but I&rsquo;m not interested in using them.)</p>
<p>When it finishes, open <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and create a new Windows 11 VM with EFI on and the VHD file as existing hard drive.</p>
<p>Boot the VM and shutdown it when OOBE language selection menu shows up. Now the VHD file is ready, it&rsquo;s time to boot it up on the bare metal!</p>
<p>(Note: for troubleshooting, refer to <a href="https://forums.ventoy.net/showthread.php?tid=370&amp;pid=3585#pid3585">meilon</a>, <a href="https://forums.ventoy.net/showthread.php?tid=416&amp;pid=1488#pid1488">midas</a> and KB<a href="https://kbhost.nl/knowledgebase/ventoy-windows-11-to-go/">Host</a>)</p>
<p>It is even better to have a similar <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/plugin_vtoyboot.html">Ventoy VDI for Linux</a>. Their instruction is very detailed and easy, so I don&rsquo;t need to repeat it here.</p>
<p>Recommendations for Flash Drive (may not apply to SSD/HDD):</p>
<ul>
<li>WTG/LiveUSB is particular fragile while tweaking/debloating or installing random drivers, so keep copies of VHD/VDI files before every major changes.</li>
<li>Disable &ldquo;Temporary paging file was created&rdquo; notification at every boot: run <code>regedit</code>, navigate to <code> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management</code> set <code>TempPageFile</code> to <code>0</code></li>
<li>Disable Prefetch/Superfetch to gain I/O performance and NAND longevity: from the same registry key above, open <code>PrefetchParameters</code> and set both <code>EnablePrefetcher</code> and <code>EnableSuperfetcher</code> to <code>0</code></li>
<li>Disable other background I/O intensive services for same reason, such as <code>Windows search</code>, <code>Windows Update</code>, <code>SysMain</code>, <code>Windows Security Service</code>, <code>Windows Defender</code>, <code>Sync Host</code>, <code>Update Orchestrator</code>, <code>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</code> and so on. <a href="https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy">privacy.sexy</a> was used for those leftover by <a href="https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder">tiny11builder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat">Win11Debloat</a>.</li>
<li>Disable misc features that doesn&rsquo;t benefit WTG but wears out flash memory:  hibernation, virtual memory, system restore, indexing, scheduled defrag and so on.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall">simplewall</a> instead of windows firewall.</li>
<li>For better hardware/software compatibility, Windows 10 LTSC 2021/2019 is a better choice where you can have Shadow Defender or Rollback RX for easier system protection/recovery.</li>
</ul>

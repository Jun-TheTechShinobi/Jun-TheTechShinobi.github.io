It was siting in my nostalgia box for years and has never been my daily driver.\nBack in time, I was a big fun of Motorola Milestone/Droid series and my main phone was the last of these QWERTY phones, Photon Q (XT897). Its keyboard was fantastic and CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4 KitKat) with XPosed framework was perfect in both productivity and aesthetics.\nMy final QWERTY phone is Nokia N900 since Motorola no longer making them. This is a phone from 2009 but I bought it after my Photon Q was broken. It was cheap compare to Neo900 and runs Maemo 5 or other open-source systems such as Firefox Mobile, Ubuntu and Kali Linux. Speaking of Neo900, it makes me remember the X62, a ThinkPad Mod.\nI don’t like to mod hardware just to keep up with the software, I’d prefer the opposite.\nI really like the idea from cheapskatesguide and lowtechmagazine that could save people from the pitfalls of consumerism. Moreover, to me it’s not about saving money on technology nor adapting certain lifestyles. This is a manifestation of ideology, the way of pursuing freedom.\n0x01 Maemo 5 Factory Reset This step is optional but I’d prefer to have a clean, latest base system to start with.\nThe official guide is very well written but those download links are already down.\nI found maemo flasher 3.5 from github with additional useful information and firmware files, also its archive.\nWith the flasher tool and two .bin files, I can follow this guide to perform the reset/upgrade.\nflasher-3.5 -F RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1_PR_COMBINED_MR0_ARM.bin -f flasher-3.5 -F RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.13-2.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin -f -R 0x02 Flashing postmarketOS  I used the SD card method and downloaded the image file from official site.\nAfter checksum, I need to use lsblk to find and edit the dd  target /dev/sdx.\nsha512sum 20221005-1522-postmarketOS-edge-i3wm-0.3-nokia-n900.img.xz xzcat 20221005-1522-postmarketOS-edge-i3wm-0.3-nokia-n900.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdx status=progress bs=1M While flashing the SD card, I can prepare the root access on Maemo by Open App manager - Update - Download - System - Sudser , this needs Wi-Fi connection.\nEither Sudser or rootsh would work, and they need “Extras repository” to download. Which should be already included with the latest firmware RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.xx.\nIn case of adding Extras manually, Open App manager - Click title bar drop-down menu - Application catalogues - New and input these then Update:\nCatalogue name: Extras Web address: http://repository.maemo.org/extras/ Distribution: fremantle Components: free non-free 0x03 Boot into U-Boot Now, power off, put the SD card with fresh postmarketOS into the phone and turn back on Maemo, Open X terminal and execute:\nsudo apt-get install u-boot-flasher If Sudser was installed properly, sudo command should go through without password prompt.\nAfter installation of u-boot, configure the entry menu by sudo vi /etc/bootmenu.d/10-pmos.item\nITEM_NAME=\"postmarketOS\" ITEM_SCRIPT=\"boot.scr\" ITEM_DEVICE=\"${EXT_CARD}p1\" ITEM_FSTYPE=\"ext2\" Create link\nsudo ln -s /etc/bootmenu.d/10-pmos.item /etc/default/bootmenu.item Update changes\nu-boot-update-bootmenu Finally, reboot the phone into the U-boot bootloader menu and boot postmarketOS.\n0x04 Usage of postmarketOS Like the official wiki, there are other articles about N900 with pmOS but solely focuses on installation rather than post-installation. People on YouTube either frustrated by stucking at the i3wm wallpaper or showing off their magical techniques. I like freedom and openess, not gatekeeping. This is the motivation behind this post.\nThe blue arrow key in combination with the Volume Up/Down to switch to a different virtual terminal. Combine with Enter key is Tab, with Backspace key is Escape, these would come handy with command-line.\nHere are some basic techniques of i3wm from the official wiki page. It’s more efficient than common desktop environments on such a constrained device.\ndefault mode shift + space: switch to \"command mode\" command mode t: open terminal k: kill current program w: workspace mode r: restart i3wm (use after modifying the config) q: go back to \"default mode\" workspace mode a/s/d/f/g: switch to workspace 1/2/3/4/5 q: go back to \"command mode\" Default Login, which can be used for local virtual terminal / text console or remote SSH.\nusername: user password: 147147 First thing to do is to say good-bye to the wallpaper by opening a terminal:\nshift + space type t then Enter\nFor security and convenience, change the default password\nsudo passwd user Connect to Wi-Fi, run nmtui then select “Activate a connection”\nsudo nmtui Set up date and time\nsudo date -s \"2022-10-xx xx:xx:xx\" sudo hwclock -w Start SSH daemon\nsudo service sshd start From now on, it’s easier to continue with SSH on a relative larger computer\nssh 192.168.x.xxx -l user #this command runs from a remote computer, not on the phone #check ip from the top right of status bar or ifconfig While checking the update, I got BAD Signature errors\nsudo apk update Fixing it by sudo vi /etc/apk/repositories, change content as below:\nhttps://mirror.postmarketos.org/postmarketos/master/ https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/latest-stable/main/ https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/latest-stable/community/ 0x05 Post-installation Softwares Web browser is considered essential in my use case. There are many options and a out-dated test review video as a reference. I did my own test anyway, that netsurf is the fastest one for simple web pages and midori is the only working one for “modern”(heavy) web pages.\nThere are also text-based browsers like vimb, w3m and lynx. No need to be limited by the application list on pmOS wiki, Arch Linux wiki is always my best friend.\nsudo apk add xxx flatpak repo provides many up-to-date applications although I didn’t find a need for that.\nsudo apk add flatpak flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo There are other tools that are useful to me, such as a GUI-based file manager, text editor and process manager. I don’t depend on CLI tools with a device that has screen.\nsudo apk add nemo gedit htop To run the installed tools, simply enter its package name e.g. gedit in the terminal of the phone.\npostmarketos-tweaks seems useful but in fact it’s not for N900. Run it withpmos-tweaks instead of its full name.\nSometimes I get connection aborted/ IO error when using sudo apk add, So I have to retry multiple times. Using sudo apk fetch instead may work better, or troubleshooting the network.\nIt maybe interesting to try install xfce4 on N900 but I feel good with i3wm for now.\nAfter installing everything, clean up the cache either by\nsudo apk -v cache clean or\nsudo rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* Then check the storage usage\ndf -h I’m using a good old humble 4GB Toshiba Class-4. It works reliably with adequate speed for N900.\nBy far, the post-installation is complete, less than 2GB of my SD card was used. Everything looks good and it’s ready to work whenever I need it.\nquitesimple even has more toys like puting LUKS encryption onto N900.\nFor me, this phone will not be a tiny server nor an open-source media player, although it can be. As I said at the beginning, it is not about making use of the phone nor my skills, not even for the love of Linux.\n",

<p>Like the official wiki, there are <a href="https://posts.oztamir.com/running-postmarketos-on-a-nokia-n900/">other articles</a> about N900 with pmOS but solely focuses on installation rather than post-installation. People on YouTube either frustrated by stucking at the i3wm wallpaper or showing off their magical techniques. <strong>I like freedom and openess, not gatekeeping</strong>. This is the motivation behind this post.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/images/e/e1/N900_keymap_us.jpg" alt="keymap"  />
</p>
<p>The <strong>blue arrow key</strong> in combination with the <strong>Volume Up/Down</strong> to switch to a different virtual terminal. Combine with <strong>Enter key</strong> is Tab, with <strong>Backspace key</strong> is Escape, these would come handy with command-line.</p>
<p>Here are some basic techniques of i3wm from <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Nokia_N900_(nokia-n900)#GUI">the official wiki page</a>. It&rsquo;s more efficient than common desktop environments on such a constrained device.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>default mode

k: kill current program

<pre tabindex="0"><code>username: user

</code></pre><p>First thing to do is to say good-bye to the wallpaper by opening a terminal:</p>
<p><code>shift + space</code> type <code>t</code> then <code>Enter</code></p>
<p>For security and convenience, change the default password</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo passwd user

<p>Web browser is considered essential in my use case. There are <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Web_browsers">many options</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ9i7AQvVrw">a out-dated test review video</a> as a reference. I did my own test anyway, that <code>netsurf</code> is the fastest one for simple web pages and <code>midori</code> is the only working one for &ldquo;modern&rdquo;(heavy) web pages.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications/Internet#Console">text-based browsers</a> like vimb, w3m and lynx. No need to be limited by the <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Applications_by_category">application list on pmOS wiki</a>, Arch Linux wiki is always my best friend.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apk add xxx
</code></pre><p><a href="https://flathub.org">flatpak repo</a> provides many up-to-date applications although I didn&rsquo;t find a need for that.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apk add flatpak

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
</code></pre><p>There are other tools that are useful to me, such as a GUI-based file manager, text editor and process manager. I don&rsquo;t depend on CLI tools with a device that has screen.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apk add nemo gedit htop
</code></pre><p>To run the installed tools, simply enter its package name e.g. <code>gedit</code> <strong>in the terminal of the phone</strong>.</p>
<p><code>postmarketos-tweaks</code> seems useful but in fact it&rsquo;s not for N900. Run it with<code>pmos-tweaks</code> instead of its full name.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get <code>connection aborted/ IO error</code> when using <code>sudo apk add</code>, So I have to retry multiple times. Using <code>sudo apk fetch</code> instead may work better, or troubleshooting the network.</p>
<p>It maybe interesting to try install <code>xfce4</code> on N900 but I feel good with i3wm for now.</p>
<p>After installing everything, clean up the cache either by</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apk -v cache clean
</code></pre><p>or</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
</code></pre><p>Then check the storage usage</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>df -h
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;m using a good old humble 4GB Toshiba Class-4. It works reliably with adequate speed for N900.</p>
<p>By far, the post-installation is complete, less than 2GB of my SD card was used. Everything looks good and it&rsquo;s ready to work whenever I need it.</p>
<p><a href="https://quitesimple.org/page/NokiaN900">quitesimple</a> even has more toys like puting LUKS encryption onto N900.</p>
<p>For me, this phone will not be a tiny server nor an open-source media player, although it can be. As I said <a href="#00x0-before-start">at the beginning</a>, it is not about making use of the phone nor my skills, not even for the love of Linux.</p>

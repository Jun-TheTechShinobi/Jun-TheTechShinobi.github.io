  "articleBody": "This is the text for a lecture I’m going to give recently. Thanks for Daniela Baron’s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.\nHey everyone. Okay, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.\nI don’t know if anyone is interested in that direction, but I digressed, let’s start.\nThis beautiful artwork is generated by me, using an AI tool called Stable Diffusion. I don’t know if any of you have already using it or something else like Midjourney, but it’s stunningly amazing.\nA humanoid AI robot from Dystopia future, confronting a wasteland scavenging survivor from post-apocalypse future. What I’m trying to express here is that, although they are confronting each other, but they really don’t know if the other is friend or foe.\nWhy? Because one thing they both are pretty damn sure about is, the catastrophe whether is about to happen or has already happened, is caused by human.\nOkay, I’ll come back to this conclusion later. Let’s start this lecture, on AI and cyber security, also some philosophy in the end.\nDoes anyone know what Shinobi means? It also relates to our today’s topic. I’ll talk about it in the end.\nReconnaissance Introduction of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) I was told this course is about reconnaissance. For me, this is a military term rather than a cyber security term. Although the culture of infosec community is heavily influenced by prior military people and government agencies, it’s still inside the umbrella of IT industry.\nWhen I was learning ethical hacking like a decade ago, it was called Footprinting. Which involves port scanning, network mapping and intel collecting. Back in the old days, there is no social media around. So when you looking for information on someone, you can’t just go online and Google search or check your collection of leaked dataset. What you do is to go for a dumpster diving. Yes, we were told by teachers and textbooks to literally collect information in the trash can. I believe it is still effective today but we just don’t have to do that any longer. Because we have better way available.\nWhich is Open-Source Intelligence, or so called OSINT. There is a link at the bottom, where you can learn more about.\nSources for OSINT Here are some common sources you can find intel using OSINT.\nNeeds for OSINT Here are who may need OSINT operation.\nStages of the Intelligence Cycle The five stages is self-explanatory, very easy to understand. You may find some variations of this but they should look identical.\nPassive vs Active OSINT Next, we have passive versus active. As you may already know, this is the fundamental concept when you collecting information for your attack or pentesting. No matter online or physically, this concept should not change.\nAI-OSINT Okay, here the AI kicks in. You can use tools like ChatGPT to generate a perfect profile for your Alias account, and it’s very hard to identify it’s a fake person.\nYou can also create video and audio contents using Synthesia or D-ID to make it even more real. It can be used in social engineering attack. So if you are like me, the only child stay very far from my family. It’s better to prepare some secrete words with them. Otherwise, if my mom is getting fraud by someone using AI with my voice, you know what would happen…\nIt can also be used to bypass security check or generating disinformation as a countermeasure to protect something you can’t simply remove from the public.\nMore Use cases Here are some more uses of AI-OSINT. PimEyes is a popular option to find more photos of someone by reverse searching just like tineye. We also need to identify what we find is belong to a real person. This can be hard while the AI is getting stronger.\nChatGPT is still locked without internet access but it will be able to do that sooner or later. By that time, or right now by using GPT4 or the microsoft alternative, you can do AI-OSINT with extra layers of protection from regulations. But this window won’t be long, and please be a decent person, do things legally. You will get caught if your countersurveillance skill is not better than your offensive skills.\nAnd even if you’re doing white hat gigs for helping some entity to do pentesting or bug bounty, that you think you are completely legal and moral and you’re doing the right thing. You can still get into troubles because others don’t think so and the law doesn’t necessarily work for people with good intentions. Unfortunately, sometimes, it can be the opposite.\nOkay, back to the topic, ChatGPT writes really good script code like python and powershell. The explanation and commenting for the code is god like, so if you’re a beginner,go try it out if you have not already.\nMore tools Here are some more tools if you would like to further exploring OSINT.\nSpiderFoot is a very versatile toolkit for OSINT and you can find more in these two links.\nAnd SANS OSINT Summit is an annual event hold by SANS institute, it’s calling for applications right now for this year. So if you’re into OSINT, don’t miss it.\nFor others who do not like proactive OSINT, but more into privacy and cyber hygiene. These two sites are great to have. Both of them are relatively late comers but they care more about average people rather than tech savvy. OSINT show and techlore can teach you from web browser, instant messenger, VPN and email provider to Operating system and private phone rom. They have videos, podcasts, books and community for you.\nIf online privacy and anonymity is not your thing, check out this document from NSA, yes, it’s from the N S A. And surprisingly, they’re really teaching you how to secure your home network and it’s very comprehensive.\nIntroduction of ChatGPT Okay, now we’re going into the hot topic. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve probably at least heard of it. So I won’t spend time repeating something you can easily find online or get answered by ChatGPT itself.\nUse cases Basically, these are the things you can do with ChatGPT for now.\nDepends on whether you’re on the Blue team or the Red team, you can either find vulnerabilities or do threat hunting with it, Write Exploits or Patches, create Malware code or Incident response plan, generate phishing emails or filtering rules, and deliver payload or get alert from logs.\nThese are nothing new to the cybersec industry, many of the SaaS products on the market have implemented with machine learning features for years. The new AI language model maybe not as robust as the existed solutions, but it can do much more, or it’s a more so called general AI than the dumb ones. So the new AI does not replace the old ML systems, but enhance and integrate .\nMore use cases If I have a whole semester to teach this lecture, I would like to login and show you some prompt engineering right now. Unfortunately, I have to leave it in the links here. Most of these video lectures have use case examples for entering prompts, and they talk about ethics quite a bit.\nThe first one will have some talk on AL model architecture and training problem, for someone who’s interested into that, which is quite in-depth.\nThe fourth one is more focusing on creating SOP for IRT, incident response team. Their processes can be a headache to manage, so ChatGPT would greatly help for doing that.\nIn the fifth video, they created logic apps for threat intelligence with csv fine tune training file. That’s really cool and it’s a more advanced use case than others.\nThe last one talked about creating phishing email, polymorphic malware which uses mutating dll injection and pentesting which nmap automating scripts. They also discussed human-machine intelligence which means people+process+AI, and how to train a good model.\nRisks If you have already into cyber security field, you may know that —“There is no silver bullet.”, and I’d like to add onto that. In the real world, “There is not only no silver bullet, but also everything is a double-edged sword.”\nThis idea is actually came from Sigmund Freud, quote “If a knife does not cut, it cannot be used for healing either.” unquote. For those who does not familiar with psychoanalysis —it’s pretty close to how we do in cybersecurity.\nIn the first link, the word OPWNAI is pretty funny and I also did my investigation on how ChatGPT can be abused by black hat in the second link.\nAt the bottom, I put a link to alert people who still trust in OpenAI blindly. Let’s get into that further.\nAs many of you may already know, there was a data breach of OpenAI recently. The way the respond to the public is absolutely unacceptable for the open source community and that reveals what the company is essentially.\nEven if you don’t care about this how AI can affect our future, it’s still worth to watch as a fun video, just about 3 minutes: How ChatGPT lied like hell to Professor Doug White about OpenAI’s recent data breach.\nOkay, at the bottom, we have two comments from Open Source Security Podcast and me.\nIn the podcast, they said “I’m not afraid of ChatGPT. I’m afraid of OpenIA.”\nIn the blog, I said “AI itself is not a threat but the capital behind it.”\nGo listen or read more if you’re interested in.\nDeep-dive into Thinking Okay, let’s relax and have some fun. Can anyone recognize these gang of four in this image?\nFrom the left, where is Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud. You may be curious why the hell these four dudes came together. Let’s find out.\nThere are four concepts related to today’s topic. The death of the subject nihilates or nullifies free will of human beings. What makes me, me is sadly just structured by the environment —the social culture, or the past I experienced, or the language I use. Nothing more than that.\nBeyond that, posthumanism denies the specialty of Homo sapiens, therefore, it accepts that AI can be the successor of humanity. This will bring our civilization into the next level and the historical responsibility of Homo sapiens is sadly going to the end.\nTranshumanism is just the philosophy term for cyborg, it’s the transition period before posthumanism. If you have a RFID chip implanted under your skin, you’re already into this transition. And Singularity is usually considered as the point of AGI or strong AI come out.\nMore Thinking I don’t know how many of you are into this direction of thinking or dislike it. Still, there are four lectures I have put links on, discussing on Art, education, society and more.\nHere is a quote I like from Plastic Pills, saying “Socrates tells a myth that before his time, the technology of writing is something that needs to be rejected. Because the technology of writing is going to destroy Humanity. Paradoxically, perhaps our definition of humanity today that it’s about to be destroyed is literacy, by AI.”\nI’m not saying to support on any side. There are something even more important that we shouldn’t ignore.\nArendt and Heidegger Hannah Arendt in her book, The Life of the Mind, said: “The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.”\nAccording to Martin Heidegger, “The danger of technology does not lie in technology itself. The essence of technology is by no means anything technological.”\nAnother quote from his book, The Question Concerning Technology, said “Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly pay homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.”\nHe said this right after the second world war which ended up with gas chambers and atomic bombs. Think about the world we’re living now, it’s not far from the great catastrophe in each direction. So, do not tunnel vision on AI itself, use the technology as the means of revealing, uncover what was concealed.\nThe real threat Here is a great documentary and some comedy shows you can learn from. Surveillance capitalism is already there, behind the scene, not a conspiracy theory at all, otherwise Edward Snowden shouldn’t be in Russia.\nTeaser for Reading Books If you’re a book reader or wanna become one. Try watch these videos and pick up some books mentioned.\nChomsky understands language and the world’s current condition quite well. He thinks ChatGPT is far from human mind and no need to worry about. The real threat to us, to our civilization are Climate Crisis, international conflicts, nuclear war, dominant political and economic systems of the world, decline of the democracy and growing inequality of wealth and power.\nAlso here is a talk between Slavoj Žižek and Yuval Harari. Zizek is considered the most dangerous or funniest philosopher today and Harari is the author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. Very interesting conversation to watch.\nIn the second video of Zizek, he said “Sometimes, the most violent thing is to do nothing.” and I agree with that. So, let’s see what we can do to overcome this unpleasant situation.\nMaking a difference First, don’t give money to OpenAI or try to pay less if you’ve already built something on it.\nSecond, contribute or support free open source software ecosystem or so called FOSS. Consider using real open source alternatives to build your project. Here are two links you can find GPT equivalents like Alpaca and LLaMA.\nThe third link is a tutorial of using Stable Diffusion on your own device, rather than paid services like Midjourney or DALL-E. By the way, it’s wrote by me. If you think it’s helpful, please share it on reddit, hacker news or other social medias you like.\nThen, consider participate or support EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation to defend digital privacy, free speech and regain our freedom.\nMaking more difference If you’re a hacker who runs or wants to start up your own company or organization, try to build on a Business Model that is more open and democratic. If you’re a hacker who just want a fair workplace, try to join a company with such attributes.\nHere’s some videos to learn from if you’re interested in.\nMore resources for hackers And more websites for those who really serious about it.\nAbout me Okay, I didn’t introduce my self at the beginning, and I won’t do it in the end.\nBecause I think I’m difficult to be categorized or labeled and I don’t have any meaningful title yet.\nBut I think what I do and what I say speaks it for me.\nLet’s head back to the meaning about Shinobi. It’s just a traditional way to say ninjia. Which means to bear something, or to suppress, restrain oneself.\nIts Chinese character constructs as a heart under blade, 『刃の下に心あり』. To me, the blade is a metaphor of technology, such as tools or weaponry. The heart is a metaphor of our mind, will or spirit. This is the opposite of our rationality, reason, intelligence, or logic—which even a strong AI would never match. That’s the humanity we should preserve and taking care of, not the opposite. The irrational unconscious part of us, such as our being and existence, love and devotion, ethics and determination, faith and religion. These are far from the animal instinct or excessive radical. Apparently, it’s impossible to speak in words, so let’s remain silent as Wittgenstein told us.\nIf you need, both the slides and texts are on my blog. Thanks for listening.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>This is the text for a lecture I&rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for <a href="https://danielabaron.me/blog/build-and-publish-presentation-with-html-and-css/">Daniela Baron&rsquo;s guide</a> which helped me tremendously for creating <a href="https://techshinobi.org/AI-CyberSec-PH-presentation/">the slides</a> with <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">RevealJS</a>.</p>
<p>Hey everyone. Okay, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is interested in that direction, but I digressed, let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/Jun-TheTechShinobi/AI-CyberSec-PH-presentation/raw/gh-pages/aivshuman.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>This beautiful artwork is generated by me, using an AI tool called Stable Diffusion. I don&rsquo;t know if any of you have already using it or something else like Midjourney, but it&rsquo;s stunningly amazing.</p>
<p>A humanoid AI robot from Dystopia future, confronting a wasteland scavenging survivor from post-apocalypse future. What I&rsquo;m trying to express here is that, although they are confronting each other, but they really don&rsquo;t know if the other is friend or foe.</p>
<p>Why? Because one thing they both are pretty damn sure about is, the catastrophe whether is about to happen or has already happened, is caused by human.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll come back to this conclusion later. Let&rsquo;s start this lecture, on AI and cyber security, also some philosophy in the end.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what Shinobi means? It also relates to our today&rsquo;s topic. I&rsquo;ll talk about it in the end.</p>
<h2 id="reconnaissance">Reconnaissance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reconnaissance">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="introduction-of-open-source-intelligence-osint">Introduction of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction-of-open-source-intelligence-osint">#</a></h3>
<p>I was told this course is about reconnaissance. For me, this is a military term rather than a cyber security term. Although the culture of infosec community is heavily influenced by prior military people and government agencies, it&rsquo;s still inside the umbrella of IT industry.</p>
<p>When I was learning ethical hacking like a decade ago, it was called Footprinting. Which involves port scanning, network mapping and intel collecting. Back in the old days, there is no social media around. So when you looking for information on someone, you can&rsquo;t just go online and Google search or check your collection of leaked dataset. What you do is to go for a dumpster diving. Yes, we were told by teachers and textbooks to literally collect information in the trash can. I believe it is still effective today but we just don&rsquo;t have to do that any longer. Because we have better way available.</p>
<p>Which is Open-Source Intelligence, or so called OSINT. There is a link at the bottom, where you can learn more about.</p>
<h3 id="sources-for-osint">Sources for OSINT<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sources-for-osint">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are some common sources you can find intel using OSINT.</p>
<h3 id="needs-for-osint">Needs for OSINT<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#needs-for-osint">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are who may need OSINT operation.</p>
<h3 id="stages-of-the-intelligence-cycle">Stages of the Intelligence Cycle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stages-of-the-intelligence-cycle">#</a></h3>
<p>The five stages is self-explanatory, very easy to understand. You may find some variations of this but they should look identical.</p>
<h3 id="passive-vs-active-osint">Passive vs Active OSINT<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#passive-vs-active-osint">#</a></h3>
<p>Next, we have passive versus active. As you may already know, this is the fundamental concept when you collecting information for your attack or pentesting. No matter online or physically, this concept should not change.</p>
<h3 id="ai-osint">AI-OSINT<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ai-osint">#</a></h3>
<p>Okay, here the AI kicks in. You can use tools like ChatGPT to generate a perfect profile for your Alias account, and it&rsquo;s very hard to identify it&rsquo;s a fake person.</p>
<p>You can also create video and audio contents <a href="https://cloudsek.com/blog/threat-actors-abuse-ai-generated-youtube-videos-to-spread-stealer-malware">using Synthesia or D-ID</a> to make it even more real. It can be used in social engineering attack. So if you are like me, the only child stay very far from my family. It&rsquo;s better to prepare some secrete words with them. Otherwise, if my mom is getting fraud by someone using AI with my voice, you know what would happen&hellip;</p>
<p>It can also be used to bypass security check or generating disinformation as a countermeasure to protect something you can&rsquo;t simply remove from the public.</p>
<h3 id="more-use-cases">More Use cases<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#more-use-cases">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are some more uses of AI-OSINT. PimEyes is a popular option to find more photos of someone by reverse searching just like tineye. We also need to identify what we find is belong to a real person. This can be hard while the AI is getting stronger.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is still locked without internet access but it will be able to do that sooner or later. By that time, or right now by using GPT4 or the microsoft alternative, you can do AI-OSINT with extra layers of protection from regulations. But this window won&rsquo;t be long, and please be a decent person, do things legally. You will get caught if your countersurveillance skill is not better than your offensive skills.</p>
<p>And even if you&rsquo;re doing white hat gigs for helping some entity to do pentesting or bug bounty, that you think you are completely legal and moral and you&rsquo;re doing the right thing. You can still get into troubles because others don&rsquo;t think so and the law doesn&rsquo;t necessarily work for people with good intentions. Unfortunately, sometimes, it can be the opposite.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the topic, ChatGPT writes really good script code like python and powershell. The explanation and commenting for the code is god like, so if you&rsquo;re a beginner,go try it out if you have not already.</p>
<h3 id="more-tools">More tools<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#more-tools">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are some more tools if you would like to further exploring OSINT.</p>
<p>SpiderFoot is a very versatile toolkit for OSINT and you can find more in these two links.</p>
<p>And SANS OSINT Summit is an annual event hold by SANS institute, it&rsquo;s calling for applications right now for this year. So if you&rsquo;re into OSINT, don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
<p>For others who do not like proactive OSINT, but more into privacy and cyber hygiene. These two sites are great to have. Both of them are relatively late comers but they care more about average people rather than tech savvy. OSINT show and techlore can teach you from web browser, instant messenger, VPN and email provider to Operating system and private phone rom. They have videos, podcasts, books and community for you.</p>
<p>If online privacy and anonymity is not your thing, check out this document from NSA, yes, it&rsquo;s from the N S A. And surprisingly, they&rsquo;re really teaching you how to secure your home network and it&rsquo;s very comprehensive.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-of-chatgpt">Introduction of ChatGPT<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction-of-chatgpt">#</a></h2>
<p>Okay, now we&rsquo;re going into the hot topic. Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you&rsquo;ve probably at least heard of it. So I won&rsquo;t spend time repeating something you can easily find online or get answered by ChatGPT itself.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use cases<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#use-cases">#</a></h3>
<p>Basically, these are the things you can do with ChatGPT for now.</p>
<p>Depends on whether you&rsquo;re on the Blue team or the Red team, you can either find vulnerabilities or do threat hunting with it, Write Exploits or Patches, create Malware code or Incident response plan, generate phishing emails or filtering rules, and deliver payload or get alert from logs.</p>
<p>These are nothing new to the cybersec industry, many of the SaaS products on the market have implemented with machine learning features for years. The new AI language model maybe not as robust as the existed solutions, but it can do much more, or it&rsquo;s a more so called general AI than the dumb ones. So the new AI does not replace the old ML systems, but enhance and integrate .</p>
<h3 id="more-use-cases-1">More use cases<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#more-use-cases-1">#</a></h3>
<p>If I have a whole semester to teach this lecture, I would like to login and show you some prompt engineering right now. Unfortunately, I have to leave it in the links here. Most of these video lectures have use case examples for entering prompts, and they talk about ethics quite a bit.</p>
<p>The first one will have some talk on AL model architecture and training problem, for someone who&rsquo;s interested into that, which is quite in-depth.</p>
<p>The fourth one is more focusing on creating SOP for IRT, incident response team. Their processes can be a headache to manage, so ChatGPT would greatly help for doing that.</p>
<p>In the fifth video, they created logic apps for threat intelligence with csv fine tune training file. That&rsquo;s really cool and it&rsquo;s a more advanced use case than others.</p>
<p>The last one talked about creating phishing email, polymorphic malware which uses mutating dll injection and pentesting which nmap automating scripts. They also discussed human-machine intelligence which  means people+process+AI, and how to train a good model.</p>
<h3 id="risks">Risks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#risks">#</a></h3>
<p>If you have already into cyber security field, you may know that —&ldquo;There is no silver bullet.&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d like to add onto that. In the real world, &ldquo;There is not only no silver bullet, but also everything is a double-edged sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea is actually came from Sigmund Freud, quote &ldquo;If a knife does not cut, it cannot be used for healing either.&rdquo; unquote. For those who does not familiar with psychoanalysis —it&rsquo;s pretty close to how we do in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>In the first link, the word OPWNAI is pretty funny and I also did my investigation on how ChatGPT can be abused by black hat in the second link.</p>
<p>At the bottom, I put a link to alert people who still trust in OpenAI blindly. Let&rsquo;s get into that further.</p>
<p>As many of you may already know, there was a data breach of OpenAI recently. The way the respond to the public is absolutely unacceptable for the open source community and that reveals what the company is essentially.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t care about this how AI can affect our future, it&rsquo;s still worth to watch as a fun video, just about 3 minutes: <a href="https://piped.video/watch?v=fxeL17ZSQJg&amp;t=739">How ChatGPT lied like hell to Professor Doug White about OpenAI&rsquo;s recent data breach</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, at the bottom, we have two comments from Open Source Security Podcast and me.</p>
<p>In the podcast, they said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of ChatGPT. I&rsquo;m afraid of OpenIA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the blog, I said &ldquo;AI itself is not a threat but the capital behind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Go listen or read more if you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<h2 id="deep-dive-into-thinking">Deep-dive into Thinking<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#deep-dive-into-thinking">#</a></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://estudioscavernarios.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/unnamed.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s relax and have some fun. Can anyone recognize these gang of four in <a href="https://estudioscavernarios.com/2021/06/09/nietzsche-marx-y-freud-la-sospecha-y-humillaciones-sobre-la-conciencia/">this image</a>?</p>
<p>From the left, where is Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud. You may be curious why the hell these four dudes came together. Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
<p>There are four concepts related to today&rsquo;s topic. The death of the subject nihilates or nullifies free will of human beings. What makes me, me is sadly just structured by the environment —the social culture, or the past I experienced, or the language I use. Nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Beyond that, posthumanism denies the specialty of Homo sapiens, therefore, it accepts that AI can be the successor of humanity. This will bring our civilization into the next level and the historical responsibility of Homo sapiens is sadly going to the end.</p>
<p>Transhumanism is just the philosophy term for cyborg, it&rsquo;s the transition period before posthumanism. If you have a RFID chip implanted under your skin, you&rsquo;re already into this transition. And Singularity is usually considered as the point of AGI or strong AI come out.</p>
<h3 id="more-thinking">More Thinking<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#more-thinking">#</a></h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of you are into this direction of thinking or dislike it. Still, there are four lectures I have put links on, discussing on Art, education, society and more.</p>
<p>Here is a quote I like from Plastic Pills, saying &ldquo;Socrates tells a myth that before his time, the technology of writing is something that needs to be rejected. Because the technology of writing is going to destroy Humanity. Paradoxically, perhaps our definition of humanity today that it&rsquo;s about to be destroyed is literacy, by AI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying to support on any side. There are something even more important that we shouldn&rsquo;t ignore.</p>
<h3 id="arendt-and-heidegger">Arendt and Heidegger<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#arendt-and-heidegger">#</a></h3>
<p>Hannah Arendt in her book, The Life of the Mind, said: &ldquo;The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Martin Heidegger, &ldquo;The danger of technology does not lie in technology itself. The essence of technology is by no means anything technological.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another quote from his book, The Question Concerning Technology, said &ldquo;Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly pay homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this right after the second world war which ended up with gas chambers and atomic bombs. Think about the world we&rsquo;re living now, it&rsquo;s not far from the great catastrophe in each direction. So, do not tunnel vision on AI itself, use the technology as the means of revealing,  uncover what was concealed.</p>
<h3 id="the-real-threat">The real threat<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-real-threat">#</a></h3>
<p>Here is a great documentary and some comedy shows you can learn from. Surveillance capitalism is already there, behind the scene, not a conspiracy theory at all, otherwise Edward Snowden shouldn&rsquo;t be in Russia.</p>
<h3 id="teaser-for-reading-books">Teaser for Reading Books<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#teaser-for-reading-books">#</a></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a book reader or wanna become one. Try watch these videos and pick up some books mentioned.</p>
<p>Chomsky understands language and the world&rsquo;s current condition quite well. He thinks ChatGPT is far from human mind and no need to worry about. The real threat to us, to our civilization are Climate Crisis, international conflicts, nuclear war, dominant political and economic systems of the world, decline of the democracy and growing inequality of wealth and power.</p>
<p>Also here is a talk between Slavoj Žižek and Yuval Harari. Zizek is considered the most dangerous or funniest philosopher today and Harari is the author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. Very interesting conversation to watch.</p>
<p>In the second video of Zizek, he said &ldquo;Sometimes, the most violent thing is to do nothing.&rdquo; and I agree with that. So, let&rsquo;s see what we can do to overcome this unpleasant situation.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-difference">Making a difference<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#making-a-difference">#</a></h3>
<p>First, don&rsquo;t give money to OpenAI or try to pay less if you&rsquo;ve already built something on it.</p>
<p>Second, contribute or support free open source software ecosystem or so called FOSS. Consider using real open source alternatives to build your project. Here are two links you can find GPT equivalents like Alpaca and LLaMA.</p>
<p>The third link is a tutorial of using Stable Diffusion on your own device, rather than paid services like Midjourney or DALL-E. By the way, it&rsquo;s wrote by me. If you think it&rsquo;s helpful, please share it on reddit, hacker news or other social medias you like.</p>
<p>Then, consider participate or support EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation to defend digital privacy, free speech and regain our freedom.</p>
<h3 id="making-more-difference">Making more difference<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#making-more-difference">#</a></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a hacker who runs or wants to start up your own company or organization, try to build on a Business Model that is more open and democratic. If you&rsquo;re a hacker who just want a fair workplace, try to join a company with such attributes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some videos to learn from if you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<h3 id="more-resources-for-hackers">More resources for hackers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#more-resources-for-hackers">#</a></h3>
<p>And more websites for those who really serious about it.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#about-me">#</a></h2>
<p>Okay, I didn&rsquo;t introduce my self at the beginning, and I won&rsquo;t do it in the end.</p>
<p>Because I think I&rsquo;m difficult to be categorized or labeled and I don&rsquo;t have any meaningful title yet.</p>
<p>But I think what I do and what I say speaks it for me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s head back to the meaning about Shinobi. It&rsquo;s just a traditional way to say ninjia. Which means to bear something, or to suppress, restrain oneself.</p>
<p>Its Chinese character constructs as a heart under blade, 『刃の下に心あり』. To me, the blade is a metaphor of technology, such as tools or weaponry. The heart is a metaphor of our mind, will or spirit. This is the opposite of our rationality, reason, intelligence, or logic—which even a strong AI would never match. That&rsquo;s the humanity we should preserve and taking care of, not the opposite.
The irrational unconscious part of us, such as our being and existence, love and devotion, ethics and determination, faith and religion. These are far from the animal instinct or excessive radical. Apparently, it&rsquo;s impossible to speak in words, so let&rsquo;s remain silent as Wittgenstein told us.</p>
<p>If you need, both the slides and texts are on my blog. Thanks for listening.</p>

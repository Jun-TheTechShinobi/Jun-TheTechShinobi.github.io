My last article on voice cloning is more than a year ago, and here we are again for adopting some latest advancement.
Refering to some Chinese source such as this blog and this video, I was attempting to adopt new tools for my audio book service, such as CosyVoice, F5-TTS, GPT-SoVITS, and fish-speech.
But before we start, I recommend to:

The model’s quality improved greatly from v2 to v4. Although when doing long text tts, errors are unavoidable, it is good enough for my use case.\nBy the time of writing this artile, they released a new version 20250606v2pro which may have some differences since I was using version 20250422v4.\nBut, you can always using their “windows package” which packed with all models and works on Linux servers despite its name, so that is intended to provide a more user friendly “one-click” experience.\nInstall on Linux\ngit clone https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS.git \u0026\u0026 cd GPT-SoVITS conda create -n GPTSoVits python=3.10 conda activate GPTSoVits #auto install script bash install.sh --source HF --download-uvr5 #(optional) manual install pip install -r extra-req.txt --no-deps pip install -r requirements.txt Install FFmpeg and other deps\nsudo apt install ffmpeg sudo apt install libsox-dev #(optional for troubleshooting) conda install -c conda-forge 'ffmpeg\u003c7' pip install -U gradio python -m nltk.downloader averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng (optional) Download Pretrained ASR Models for Chinese\ngit lfs install cd tools/asr/models/ git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/iic/speech_fsmn_vad_zh-cn-16k-common-pytorch.git tools/asr/models/speech_fsmn_vad_zh-cn-16k-common-pytorch git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/iic/punc_ct-transformer_zh-cn-common-vocab272727-pytorch.git tools/asr/models/punc_ct-transformer_zh-cn-common-vocab272727-pytorch git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/iic/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch.git tools/asr/models/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch After all done, run GRADIO_SHARE=0 GRADIO_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=0 DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 DO_NOT_TRACK=1 python -m webui.py to start server then access via http://ip:9874/\n0-Fetch dataset preparation-for-vocal-recording\nI used Audacity instead of UVR5 because the recording is clean and clear.\nUse the webui built-in audio slicer to slice the new recording.wav and put old recordings (if any) all together under output/slicer_opt\nUse built-in batch ASR tool with faster whisper, since I’m doing multilingual model this time.\nThese issues are related exclusively with old GPU architecture. No worries for new GPU (30x0/40x0) users.\nTroubleshooting 1 RuntimeError: parallel_for failed: cudaErrorNoKernelImageForDevice: no kernel image is available for execution on the device.\npip uninstall -y ctranslate2 pip install ctranslate2==3.24.0 Troubleshooting 2 'iwrk': array([], dfitpack_int), 'u': array([], float),\npip uninstall numpy scipy pip install numba==0.60.0 numpy==1.26.4 scipy After transcription finished, use built-in labeling tool(subfix) to remove bad samples. If the web page doesn’t pop-up, use ip:9871 manually. Choose Audio and Delete Audio, Save File when finished.\n1-GPT-SOVITS-TTS 1A-Dataset formatting Fill up the empty fields and click Set One-Click Formatting:\n#Text labelling file /home/username/GPT-SoVITS/output/asr_opt/slicer_opt.list #Audio dataset folder output/slicer_opt 1B-Fine-tuned training 1Ba-SoVITS training Use batch size at 1, total epoch at 5 and save_every_epoch at 1.\n1Bb-GPT training For this part, my batch size is 6 with DPO enabled. Total traning epochs should be around 5-15, adjust Save frequency based on needs.\nTroubleshooting for old GPUs Error: cuFFT doesn't support signals of half type with compute capability less than SM_53, but the device containing input half tensor only has SM_52.\nFix1: Eidt webui.py, add a new line after from multiprocessing import cpu_count with is_half = False Fix2: Edit GPT_SoVITS/s2_train.py, add hps.train.fp16_run = False at beginning (among with torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False)\n1C-inference click refreshing model paths and select model in both lists\nCheck Enable Parallel Inference Version then open TTS Inference WebUI, this need a while to load, manually access ip:9872 if needed.\nTroubleshooting for ValueError: Due to a serious vulnerability issue in torch.load fix by pip install transformers==4.43\nInference Settings:\ne3.ckpt e15.pth Primary Reference Audio with Text and multiple reference audio Slice by every punct top_k 5 top_p 1 temperature 0.9 Repetition Penalty 2 speed_factor 1.3 Keep everything else default.\nTo find the best GPT weight, parameters and random seed, first inferencing on a large block of text and pick up a few problematic sentences for next inference. Then, adjust GPT weight and parameters to make the problem go away while on a fixed seed number. Once the best GPT weight and parameters are found, fix them then play with difference seed number to refine the final result. Take note on the parameters when inference gets perfect for future use.\nFish Speech Fish-speech is contributed by the same people from Bert-vits2 which I used for a long time.\nFollowing their official docs to install version 1.4 (unfortunately, v1.5 has problem of sound quality while finetuning)\ngit clone --branch v1.4.3 https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech.git \u0026\u0026 cd fish-speech conda create -n fish-speech python=3.10 conda activate fish-speech pip3 install torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 apt install libsox-dev ffmpeg apt install build-essential \\ cmake \\ libasound-dev \\ portaudio19-dev \\ libportaudio2 \\ libportaudiocpp0 pip3 install -e .

For the first run, I set max_steps: 10000 and val_check_interval: 1000 to have 5 models that have lower steps with some diversity . Things like lr, weight_decay and num_warmup_steps can be further adjusted accroding to this article. My setting is lr: 1e-5, weight_decay: 1e-6, num_warmup_steps: 500. To check to training metrics such as loss curve, run tensorboard --logdir fish-speech/results/tensorboard/version_xx/ and access localhost:6006 via browser. Determine overfitting with the graph AND actuall hear to the inference result for each checkpoint. At first I found out overfitting starts around 5000 step. Then a a second training for 5000 steps and find the best result is step_000004000.ckpt. Training requires a newer GPU with bf16 and no workaround so far. When training a model for inferencing on an older GPU, use precision: 32-true in fish_speech/configs/text2semantic_finetune.yaml and result += (self.lora_dropout(x).to(torch.float32) @ self.lora_A.to(torch.float32).transpose(0, 1) @ self.lora_B.to(torch.float32).transpose(0, 1)) * self.scaling.to(torch.float32) in/home/username/miniconda3/envs/fish-speech/lib/python3.10/site-packages/loralib/layers.py. Training would take many hours on weak GPU.

<p><a href="https://techshinobi.org/posts/voice-vits/">My last article</a> on voice cloning is more than a year ago, and here we are again for adopting some latest advancement.</p>
<p>Refering to some Chinese source such as <a href="https://www.tangshuang.net/9063.html">this blog</a> and <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hukmYhEJX">this video</a>, I was attempting to adopt new tools for my audio book service, such as <a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice">CosyVoice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS/">F5-TTS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS">GPT-SoVITS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech">fish-speech</a>.</p>
<p>But before we start, I recommend to:</p>
<p>Install miniconda for dependency sanity</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh &amp;&amp; sudo chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh &amp;&amp; bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
</code></pre><p>Setup <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#linux-and-windows-2">PyTorch environment</a> as needed and confirm with <code>python -m torch.utils.collect_env</code></p>
<p>Install <code>nvtop</code> if preferred by <code>sudo apt install nvtop</code></p>
<h3 id="gpt-sovits">GPT-SoVITS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#gpt-sovits">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS">This project</a> is made by same group of people from <a href="https://techshinobi.org/posts/voice-vits/#so-vits-svc">so-vits-svc</a>. The model&rsquo;s quality improved greatly from v2 to v4. Although when doing long text tts, errors are unavoidable, it is good enough for my use case.</p>
<p>By the time of writing this artile, they released a new version <code>20250606v2pro</code> which may have some differences since I was using version <code>20250422v4</code>.</p>
<p>But, you can always using their <a href="https://huggingface.co/lj1995/GPT-SoVITS-windows-package/tree/main">&ldquo;windows package&rdquo;</a> which packed with all models and works on Linux servers despite its name, so that is intended to provide a more user friendly &ldquo;one-click&rdquo; experience.</p>
<p>Install on Linux</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git clone https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS.git &amp;&amp; cd GPT-SoVITS
conda create -n GPTSoVits python=3.10

<p><a href="https://techshinobi.org/posts/voice-vits/#preparation-for-vocal-recording">preparation-for-vocal-recording</a></p>
<p>I used Audacity instead of UVR5 because the recording is clean and clear.</p>
<p>Use the webui built-in audio slicer to slice the new recording.wav and put old recordings (if any) all together under <code>output/slicer_opt</code></p>
<p>Use built-in batch ASR tool with faster whisper, since I&rsquo;m doing multilingual model this time.</p>
<p>These issues are related exclusively with old GPU architecture. No worries for new GPU (30x0/40x0) users.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jianchang512/stt/issues/51">Troubleshooting 1</a> <code>RuntimeError: parallel_for failed: cudaErrorNoKernelImageForDevice: no kernel image is available for execution on the device.</code></p>

<p>1Ba-SoVITS training
Use <code>batch size</code> at <code>1</code>, <code>total epoch</code> at <code>5</code> and <code>save_every_epoch</code> at <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>1Bb-GPT training
For this part, my <code>batch size</code> is <code>6</code> with <code>DPO enabled</code>. Total traning epochs should be around 5-15, adjust Save frequency based on needs.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting for old GPUs
Error: <code>cuFFT doesn't support signals of half type with compute capability less than SM_53,  but the device containing input half tensor only has SM_52</code>.</p>
<p>Fix1: Eidt <code>webui.py</code>, add a new line after <code>from multiprocessing import cpu_count</code> with <code>is_half = False</code>
Fix2: Edit <code>GPT_SoVITS/s2_train.py</code>, add <code>hps.train.fp16_run = False</code> at beginning (among with <code>torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False</code>)</p>
<h5 id="1c-inference">1C-inference<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1c-inference">#</a></h5>
<p>click <code>refreshing model paths</code> and select model in both lists</p>
<p>Check <code>Enable Parallel Inference Version</code> then <code>open TTS Inference WebUI</code>, this need a while to load, manually access <code>ip:9872</code> if needed.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting for <code>ValueError: Due to a serious vulnerability issue in torch.load</code> fix by <code>pip install transformers==4.43</code></p>
<p>Inference Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>e3.ckpt</li>
<li>e15.pth</li>
<li>Primary Reference Audio with Text and multiple reference audio</li>
<li>Slice by every punct</li>
<li>top_k 5</li>
<li>top_p 1</li>
<li>temperature 0.9</li>
<li>Repetition Penalty 2</li>
<li>speed_factor 1.3</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep everything else default.</p>
<p>To find the best GPT weight, parameters and random seed, first inferencing on a large block of text and pick up a few problematic sentences for next inference. Then, adjust GPT weight and parameters to make the problem go away while on a fixed seed number.  Once the best GPT weight and parameters are found, fix them then play with difference seed number to refine the final result. Take note on the parameters when inference gets perfect for future use.</p>

<ul>
<li>The default numbers are too high for my setup, so both <code>num_workers</code> and <code>batch_size</code> needs to be lowered <a href="https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/advanced/speed.html#num-workers">according to CPU cores and VRAM</a>.</li>
<li>For the first run, I set <code>max_steps: 10000</code> and <code>val_check_interval: 1000</code> to have 5 models that have lower steps with some diversity .</li>
<li>Things like <code>lr</code>, <code>weight_decay</code> and <code>num_warmup_steps</code> can be further adjusted accroding to <a href="https://modal.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms-hyperparameters-glossary-article">this article</a>. My setting is <code>lr: 1e-5</code>, <code>weight_decay: 1e-6</code>, <code>num_warmup_steps: 500</code>.</li>
<li>To check to training metrics such as loss curve, run <code>tensorboard --logdir fish-speech/results/tensorboard/version_xx/</code> and access <code>localhost:6006</code> via browser. Determine overfitting with the graph AND actuall hear to the inference result for each checkpoint.</li>
<li>At first I found out overfitting starts around 5000 step. Then a a second training for 5000 steps and find the best result is <code>step_000004000.ckpt</code>.</li>
<li>Training requires a newer GPU with <a href="https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed/issues/6723">bf16</a> and no workaround so far.</li>
<li>When training a model for inferencing on an older GPU, use <code>precision: 32-true</code> in <code>fish_speech/configs/text2semantic_finetune.yaml</code> and <code>result += (self.lora_dropout(x).to(torch.float32) @ self.lora_A.to(torch.float32).transpose(0, 1) @ self.lora_B.to(torch.float32).transpose(0, 1)) * self.scaling.to(torch.float32)</code> in<code>/home/username/miniconda3/envs/fish-speech/lib/python3.10/site-packages/loralib/layers.py</code>.</li>

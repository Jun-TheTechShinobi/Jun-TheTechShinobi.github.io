<p>As a early adopter of Protonmail, I use their later coming VPN product as well, regularly yet lightly. Although I&rsquo;m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.</p>
<p>Being a free account user, I&rsquo;ve never done torrenting or any other heavy usage on their servers. It is not moral even though the provider allows me to.</p>
<p>Probably because of my account was old enough so that my country selection feature wasn&rsquo;t banned until latest update.</p>
<p>There are some concerns that preventing me from paying their services to regain that feature. It&rsquo;s not about their product, but more about their business strategy.</p>
<p>Although there are always some criticism and antagonism among the community.</p>

<p>But my stand is more towards where <a href="https://youtu.be/9ZLMDMk5rzk">All Things Secured</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZZphjOABE4Y">Techlore</a> are. That is, as long as Proton is better than Google, issue with registration, warrant canary or false advertising are tolerable. However, now I&rsquo;ll be putting a question mark on that though.</p>
<p>Protonmail was like another Tutanota, and Proton VPN was like another IVPN/PIA. But, is it? still&hellip;by now?</p>

<p>Does this market strategy sound familiar? Yes, my concern is that Proton now looks too much like baby Google back in the days. Free users are going to be their products, and that is <a href="https://youtu.be/rimtaSgGz_4">when enshittification starts</a>.</p>

<p>So the solution is to ditch their official client and use a 3rd party open-source alternative.</p>
<p>This is pretty much the same way as <a href="https://protonvpn.com/support/installing-protonvpn-on-a-router/">using Proton VPN on a router</a>.</p>
<p>There are official OpenVPN guides on the <a href="https://account.protonvpn.com/downloads">account&rsquo;s downloads page</a> for every single platform on how to manually install and connect your configuration files based on the server of your choice.</p>

<p>But what I did is <a href="https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-configurations/">WireGuard</a>.

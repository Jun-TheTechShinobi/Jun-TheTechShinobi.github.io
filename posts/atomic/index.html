Last year, I set up my Monero Wallet with Kicksecure and happy about it. This distro is really lightweight and easy to use. However, it failed completely after a recent upgrade, which was a major version leap from Debian 12 to 13.
It lost drivers, desktop environment stopped working and probably much more which I couldn&rsquo;t discover because I stacked at a login screen loop. After troubleshooting for a couple of hours, it turns out all lightdm related DEs are unusable and Gnome and KDE are working.">

The secureblue team recommends Flatpak and Homebrew which I don’t like so much, thankfully with run0 and rpm-ostree, I can virtually install any fedora packages as wish.\nTo enable rpmfusion repo for a larger software pool, just run these in the terminal:\nrpm-ostree install \\ https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm \\ https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm systemctl reboot To enable 3rd party repo and install software like Mullvad browser, run in terminal:\ndnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://repository.mullvad.net/rpm/stable/mullvad.repo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://repository.mullvad.net/rpm/stable/mullvad.repo rpm-ostree install mullvad-browser After some testing, my ThinkPad loves secureblue very much but it boots and runs very slow on my very out-dated ThinkCentre.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found myself with enough leisure and motivation to set up a crypto wallet. For my situation, investing time and money into my skills, knowledge, and projects yields more return and safer than in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this time, I found some good VPN deals which I would like to pay with XMR. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to have some spare crypto in wallet  for making donations to my favorite creators and projects, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to set things up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kali-linux--freshtomato&#34;&gt;Kali Linux &amp;amp; FreshTomato&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parrot OS was on my old ThinkPad for many years. I recently upgraded it and had some issue with my multi-bootloader. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not Parrot OS&amp;rsquo;s fault, I switched to Kali Linux as a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this pentesting system since early BackTrack era but never felt it ought to be installed on a hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphic installer is much simpler than Parrot OS that may not be an issue for most people. My complain is just because my multi-boot hard drive has a very complex partition structure where an advanced installer is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

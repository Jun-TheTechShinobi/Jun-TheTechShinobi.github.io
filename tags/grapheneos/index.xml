      <description>Back to the Command-line For some reason, MS Edge for Linux does not have the Read Aloud feature which is the only reason I would like to use Edge. The TTS engine made by Microsoft sounds incomparable to those poorly made chrome extensions.
Therefore, I found a work around with edge-tts. This is a CLI tool uses Edge TTS service. The instruction on its Github repo is very good.
After installation, use edge-tts --list-voices | grep US to show English speaking characters and now I can locate a text file in the terminal to be read.</description>

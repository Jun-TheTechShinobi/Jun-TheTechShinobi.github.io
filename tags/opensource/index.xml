      <description>Last year, I bought a Metro locked Oneplus Nord N30 5G (CPH2513/CPH2515) for $60 during a very slick deal.
However, this phone was completely unusable due to it is haunted with tons of bloatware and spyware. So I decided to let it sit in a drawer for 180 days and then see what I can do with it.
A few days ago, I unlocked it by simply go to About Phone then click Unlock.</description>

      <description>A Deep Dive into Voice Cloning with SoftVC VITS and Bert-VITS2 In the previous post, I have tried a little bit of TTS Generation WebUI and found it&amp;rsquo;s interesting. So, I decide to train a usable model with my own voice.
This voice cloning project explores both SVC for Voice Changing and VITS for Text-to-Speech. There is no one tool does all jobs.
I have tested several tools for this project.</description>

      <description>Cheapskate&amp;rsquo;s NAS Migration from Unraid to Openmediavault For decades, I come across a lot of abandoned computers and recycled parts out of them.
This article is about the recycled Dell Vostro 220s with LGA771 to LGA775 Mod I mentioned in the last post.
It was running Unraid with a low power Xeon L5410 and 2 GB of RAM for many years. The only repair was a PSU replacement two years ago.</description>

      <description>Old Stories The computer hardware used to be more playful and worth tinkering. My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.
Back in the days, I used to repair people&amp;rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it. Then, I bought a cheap E3-1245 and GTX 750 Ti to make it a gaming rig.</description>

      <description>I use Generate-subtitles  as an alternative or substitute to YouTube closed captions (CC) since it does not always work as expected.
When creating video contents, it comes very handy to have a high quality generated transcripts to start with. My favorite tools are Subtitle Edit and Aegisub. SE provides a great online version and works with .SRT format which fits great into my Adobe Premiere Pro workflow. It also has built-in Auto Translation and Whisper support.</description>

      <description>This is the text for a lecture I&amp;rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for Daniela Baron&amp;rsquo;s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.
Hey everyone. Well, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.</description>

      <description>No DALL-E, No Midjourney and No Colab This is a guide showing how to build your own stable diffusion server on what you already have or cheap used hardwares. It may not satisfy for a serious production use but pretty viable for learning, testing or casual use.
Before we start, here&amp;rsquo;s some comments on OpenAI:
 The history of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which Elon Musk helped found before parting ways and criticizing OpenAI Is Now Everything It Promised Not to Be: Corporate, Closed-Source, and For-Profit Will ChatGPT be open source?</description>

      <description>In This Day and Age? Back then, when MySpace and 000webhost was the thing. I wrote blog regularly about my life and hobby. That was the beginning of my Internet journey and tweaking CSS code while posting an article was fun.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to post my stuff on somewhere like mastodon or telegram channel but here I am. Because I feel most comfortable this way.
Dilemma of Giving Back The beginning of my Linux journey was with some early version of OpenWrt and BackTrack, then Puppy and Ubuntu.</description>

      <title>Self-hosting Local LLMs (DeepSeek-R1) Easily with Harbor (Ollama&#43;Open-WebUI&#43;SearXNG)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, there is a need of private chatbot service as a complete alternative to OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT. So, I decide to implement one at home and make it accessible to everyone in my household alongside with my network printer and NAS (OpenMediaVault).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I used to recommend people using Llama series for English tasks and Qwen series for Chinese tasks. There was no open-source model that&amp;rsquo;s strong enough in multilingual tasks comparing to proprietary ones (GPT/Claude).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Set up Monero Wallet Securely with Anonymity</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/menero-wallet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found myself with enough leisure and motivation to set up a crypto wallet. For my situation, investing time and money into my skills, knowledge, and projects yields more return and safer than in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this time, I found some good VPN deals which I would like to pay with XMR. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to have some spare crypto in wallet  for making donations to my favorite creators and projects, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to set things up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dealing with the Enshittification of Proton VPN on Free Plan&#39;s Server Selection</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/proton-shit/</link>

      <guid>https://techshinobi.org/posts/proton-shit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a early adopter of Protonmail, I use their later coming VPN product as well, regularly yet lightly. Although I&amp;rsquo;m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a free account user, I&amp;rsquo;ve never done torrenting or any other heavy usage on their servers. It is not moral even though the provider allows me to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably because of my account was old enough so that my country selection feature wasn&amp;rsquo;t banned until latest update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>USB Tethering a Portable Router into a Mobile WiFi Hotspot</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/tethering-hotspot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://techshinobi.org/posts/tethering-hotspot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I came down to want a mobile hotspot when going out of home, something like Netgear Nighthawk M series, but able to flash custom firmware (OpenWrt/pfSense equivalents) and cheap. However, there is no such thing on the market even without budget consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it has to be done with DIY, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://OpenWrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wan/smartphone.usb.tethering&#34;&gt;USB tethering with a router&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of tethering or so called Ethernet over USB, we are using a phone as a cellular modem for our router.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Self-hosting RustDesk Server via Docker Compose</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/rustdesk-server/</link>

      <guid>https://techshinobi.org/posts/rustdesk-server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk&#34;&gt;RustDesk&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite remote desktop tool which is the best alternative to any closed-source solutions, such as TeamViewer and Anydesk. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda like Bitwarden in the post-breach era of the cloud password manager (LastPass/1Password) market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a light user of RustDesk, I use it only occasionally. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t setup my own RD server on VPS even though &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/rustdesk/comments/1cr8kfv/should_you_selfhost_a_rustdesk_server/&#34;&gt;I suppose to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, one of my RustDesk client got blocked to the official servers. So now I have enough reason to properly making it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ethics of Local LLMs: A Response to Zuckerberg&#39;s &#39;&#39;Open Source AI Manifesto&#39;&#39;</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/ethics-llm/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-open-source-ai-manifesto&#34;&gt;the &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/facebook.html&#34;&gt;hated by Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; for decades and he is the only person who appears on both cover image of the video essays: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/oLLxpAZzy0s&#34;&gt;How the Internet was Stolen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/BQTXv5jm6s4&#34;&gt;How AI was Stolen&lt;/a&gt; by Then &amp;amp; Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things has changed recently after his adoption of the Fediverse and &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/lJ_NRIKbRKc&#34;&gt;open-sourcing of Llama&lt;/a&gt; continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/&#34;&gt;Zuckerberg&amp;rsquo;s latest &amp;ldquo;Open Source AI Manifesto&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, he stated 5 needs of open-source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to train, fine-tune, and distill our own models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to control our own destiny and not get locked into a closed vendor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to protect our data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need a model that is efficient and affordable to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to invest in the ecosystem thatâ€™s going to be the standard for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That describes the needs of tech individuals and small businesses accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimenting Lip Syncing Deepfake Tools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI-Generated content can be fun or &amp;ldquo;slop&amp;rdquo; according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/slop/&#34;&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt;, but also can be malevolent due to its abuse in phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my readers may have already known that recently I&amp;rsquo;m working on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.techshinobi.org/&#34;&gt;side project&lt;/a&gt; , which based on&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/appatalks/chatgpt-html&#34;&gt;chatgpt-html&lt;/a&gt; and uses LLMs to detect phishing emails. I think at some point, the tool should be able to detect phishing attempt from video content too. Because deepfake technology is so accessible nowadays and its generated content can be quite convincing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dehaunting OnePlus Nord N30 5G</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/opn30/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I bought a Metro locked Oneplus Nord N30 5G (CPH2513/CPH2515) for $60 during a very slick deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this phone was completely unusable due to it is haunted with tons of bloatware and spyware. So I decided to let it sit in a drawer for 180 days and then see what I can do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I unlocked it by simply go to &lt;code&gt;About Phone&lt;/code&gt; then click &lt;code&gt;Unlock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into Voice Cloning with SoftVC VITS and Bert-VITS2</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/voice-vits/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-deep-dive-into-voice-cloning-with-softvc-vits-and-bert-vits2&#34;&gt;A Deep Dive into Voice Cloning with SoftVC VITS and Bert-VITS2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/posts/cheapai/#tts-generation-webui&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I have tried a little bit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui&#34;&gt;TTS Generation WebUI&lt;/a&gt; and found it&amp;rsquo;s interesting. So, I decide to train a usable model with my own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This voice cloning project explores both SVC for Voice Changing and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits&#34;&gt;VITS&lt;/a&gt; for Text-to-Speech. There is no one tool does all jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tested several tools for this project. Many of the good guides, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SUC-DriverOld/so-vits-svc-Chinese-Detaild-Documents&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Hr4y197Cy&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yuque.com/umoubuton/ueupp5&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, are in Chinese. So, I thought it&amp;rsquo;s useful to post my notes in English.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For decades, I come across a lot of abandoned computers and recycled parts out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is about the recycled &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/posts/cheapai/#old-stories&#34;&gt;Dell Vostro 220s with LGA771 to LGA775 Mod&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned in the last post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was running Unraid with a low power Xeon L5410 and 2 GB of RAM for many years. The only repair was a PSU replacement two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;old-stories&#34;&gt;Old Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer hardware used to be more playful and worth tinkering. My favorate platfom from a decade ago, Sandy Bridge on LGA 1155, can still be powerful even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the days, I used to repair people&amp;rsquo;s electronics for free. Because of that, I also received a lots of spares and e-waste in exchange. One of the best was a LGA 1155 motherboard with i5-2300 on it. Then, I bought a cheap E3-1245 and GTX 750 Ti to make it a gaming rig. I played a lot of games on that, such as Dark Souls series and Metro series. Before it was sold, last games I played on this build was Metro Exodus and Elden Ring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up a Wisper Server with GUI using Generate-subtitles</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/gensub-whisper/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mayeaux/generate-subtitles&#34;&gt;Generate-subtitles &lt;/a&gt; as an alternative or substitute to YouTube closed captions (CC) since it does not always work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating video contents, it comes very handy to have a high quality generated transcripts to start with. My favorite tools are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit&#34;&gt;Subtitle Edit&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://aegisub.org/&#34;&gt;Aegisub&lt;/a&gt;. SE provides a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit/online&#34;&gt;online version&lt;/a&gt; and works with .SRT format which fits great into my Adobe Premiere Pro workflow. It also has built-in Auto Translation and Whisper support. Aegisub works with .ASS format which fits into &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kilo19/NixieVideoKit&#34;&gt;NixieVideoKit&lt;/a&gt; automated workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI CyberSecurity, ChatGPT and Post-humanism</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/aisecph/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the text for a lecture I&amp;rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielabaron.me/blog/build-and-publish-presentation-with-html-and-css/&#34;&gt;Daniela Baron&amp;rsquo;s guide&lt;/a&gt; which helped me tremendously for creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/AI-CyberSec-PH-presentation/&#34;&gt;the slides&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/&#34;&gt;RevealJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Well, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if anyone is interested in that direction, but I digressed, let&amp;rsquo;s get to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cheapskate&#39;s Stable Diffusion Server</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/cheapsd/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-dall-e-no-midjourney-and-no-colab&#34;&gt;No DALL-E, No Midjourney and No Colab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a guide showing how to build your own stable diffusion server on what you already have or cheap used hardwares. It may not satisfy for a serious production use but pretty viable for learning, testing or casual use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, here&amp;rsquo;s some comments on OpenAI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-openai-company-chatgpt-elon-musk-founded-2022-12&#34;&gt;The history of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which Elon Musk helped found before parting ways and criticizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3naz/openai-is-now-everything-it-promised-not-to-be-corporate-closed-source-and-for-profit&#34;&gt;OpenAI Is Now Everything It Promised Not to Be: Corporate, Closed-Source, and For-Profit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://scribe.nixnet.services/geekculture/will-chatgpt-be-open-source-4b2928d57a2&#34;&gt;Will ChatGPT be open source?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/24/column/&#34;&gt;ChatGPT, how did you get here? It was a long journey through open source AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tcrn.ch/3MKBD5P&#34;&gt;When big AI labs refuse to open source their models, the community steps in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Sqa8Zo2XWc4&#34;&gt;Artificial Intelligence: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/hZTv-R6E32Y&#34;&gt;The TRUTH about OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using ChatGPT and its API regulary. Since my &lt;a href=&#34;https://techshinobi.org/posts/bypass-chatgpt/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, the API has been upgraded to gpt-3.5-turbo which broke my program and gpt-4 seems coming up soon. Therefore, I may not fix my code proactively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Started This Blog</title>
      <link>https://techshinobi.org/posts/why-i-started/</link>

      <guid>https://techshinobi.org/posts/why-i-started/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-this-day-and-age&#34;&gt;In This Day and Age?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, when MySpace and 000webhost was the thing. I wrote blog regularly about my life and hobby. That was the beginning of my Internet journey and tweaking CSS code while posting an article was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to post my stuff on somewhere like mastodon or telegram channel but here I am. Because I feel most comfortable this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dilemma-of-giving-back&#34;&gt;Dilemma of Giving Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of my Linux journey was with some early version of OpenWrt and BackTrack, then Puppy and Ubuntu. At this very moment, I&amp;rsquo;m typing with MarkText on a Pop!_OS and all my servers are running on either CentOS or Debian.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

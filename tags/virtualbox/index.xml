      <description>Last time, I mentioned Creating Ventoy VDI for Linux Live USB , however, it may not boot on some strange hardware and I unfortunately have quite a few of those. So in such cases, it&amp;rsquo;s better to boot Linux natively.
By doing this, we need Rescuezilla/Clonezilla to extract the Linux system out of Virtualbox&amp;rsquo;s hard drive (VDI/VMDK).
Download and load the ISO of Rescuezilla, a GUI version of Clonezilla, it&amp;rsquo;s larger but eaiser to use.</description>

      <description>Windows Nostalgia A recent video on Windows 7 as daily driver OS by Brodie Robertson was hilarious but also arguable.
For me, XP is the best OS ever made by M$. However, it has became not so useful nowadays neither for retro gaming (which 98SE is the king) nor for day-to-day usage, due to both hardware and software incompatibility.
The compromise would be Windows 7. I agree there are too much of accumulated unpatched security vulnerabilities, but there are tricks to mitigate most of those either technically or strategically.</description>

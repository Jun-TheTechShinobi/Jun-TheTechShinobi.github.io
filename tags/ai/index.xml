      <description>I use Generate-subtitles  as an alternative or substitute to YouTube closed captions (CC) since it does not always work as expected.
When creating video contents, it comes very handy to have a high quality generated transcripts to start with. My favorite tools are Subtitle Edit and Aegisub. SE provides a great online version and works with .SRT format which fits great into my Adobe Premiere Pro workflow. It also has built-in Auto Translation and Whisper support.</description>

      <description>This is the text for a lecture I&amp;rsquo;m going to give recently. Thanks for Daniela Baron&amp;rsquo;s guide which helped me tremendously for creating the slides with RevealJS.
Hey everyone. Well, first, I have to confess and apologize that I could not prepare this enough. Because I have to working on my dissertation, which also discusses about AI augmented APT attack such as using ChatGPT to create phishing email and ransomware code.</description>

      <description>The latest news updated on waylaidwanderer&amp;rsquo;s repo says:
 2023-02-15 The method we were using to access the ChatGPT raw models has been patched, unfortunately.
 Therefore, the party is over. It was fun to play with those leaked models such as text-davinci-002-render, text-chat-davinci-002-20221122, and text-chat-davinci-002-sh-alpha-aoruigiofdj83. They&amp;rsquo;re not as good as the official model text-davinci-003 after all as my previous post said.
Why use API instead of the Ordinary Way After OpenAI fired up their paid subscription for ChatGPT, availability issue like response error, rate limit and throttling become more often.</description>

      <description>The Original Flavors In OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s documentation there are 4 models under GPT-3 category and 2 coding models. They cost from $0.02 to $0.0004 per 1k tokens as the base model and the fine-tuned versions cost even more.
 text-davinci-003 text-curie-001 text-babbage-001 text-ada-001 code-davinci-002 code-cushman-001  The playground can test them all using the web interface.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how good they are comparing to the free ChatGPT.

      <description>2024 Update MrChromebox.tech had a major update a few month ago, so I decide to move on as well.
But before that, use Clonezilla or rsync -aHAXS to back up the 32 GB emmc first.
Run in terminal, install &amp;ldquo;Full UEFI Firmware&amp;rdquo; cd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo bash firmware-util.sh
After reboot, a full version of coreboot is installed, by replacing the previous SeaBIOS which is partial and limited.
This makes this laptop now with a free firmware.</description>

      <description>Last year, I bought a Metro locked Oneplus Nord N30 5G (CPH2513/CPH2515) for $60 during a very slick deal.
However, this phone was completely unusable due to it is haunted with tons of bloatware and spyware. So I decided to let it sit in a drawer for 180 days and then see what I can do with it.
A few days ago, I unlocked it by simply go to About Phone then click Unlock.</description>

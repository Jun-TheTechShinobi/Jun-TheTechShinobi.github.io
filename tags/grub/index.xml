      <description>Last time, I mentioned Creating Ventoy VDI for Linux Live USB , however, it may not boot on some strange hardware and I unfortunately have quite a few of those. So in such cases, it&amp;rsquo;s better to boot Linux natively.
By doing this, we need Rescuezilla/Clonezilla to extract the Linux system out of Virtualbox&amp;rsquo;s hard drive (VDI/VMDK).
Download and load the ISO of Rescuezilla, a GUI version of Clonezilla, it&amp;rsquo;s larger but eaiser to use.</description>

      <description>Background Story Last week, I experienced a major data loss on my daily driver computer due to encryption failure. Last time I had encountered this sort of situation was over a decade ago with TrueCrypt on an external HDD and unfortunately lost everything that weren&amp;rsquo;t backed up. I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered everything from backup this time so I decide to document it.
The entire storage on my daily driver is encrypted with LUKS and it suddenly fails on boot decryption.</description>

      <description>The latest news updated on waylaidwanderer&amp;rsquo;s repo says:
 2023-02-15 The method we were using to access the ChatGPT raw models has been patched, unfortunately.
 Therefore, the party is over. It was fun to play with those leaked models such as text-davinci-002-render, text-chat-davinci-002-20221122, and text-chat-davinci-002-sh-alpha-aoruigiofdj83. They&amp;rsquo;re not as good as the official model text-davinci-003 after all as my previous post said.
Why use API instead of the Ordinary Way After OpenAI fired up their paid subscription for ChatGPT, availability issue like response error, rate limit and throttling become more often.</description>
